Although it contained no actual real-world hockey teams, it did contain several teams based on real North American cities. For its Famicom Disk System adaptation it was called Konami (or Konamic) Ice Hockey.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">There are eight playable teams that are based in real North American cities but bear no relation to their NHL counterparts. The eight teams are Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Chicago, and New York. Each team has one anonymous line of 3 forwards, 2 defensemen and 1 goalie.</p><p style=\"\">There are two game types: Exhibition and Tournament. In Exhibition, the player takes on either a CPU or another human-controlled team for a single match. In Tournament, the player’s team is placed into a three-round elimination tournament. Both game types can be played on three difficulty levels; Junior, College and Pro.</p><p style=\"\">Although the matches are structured the same as regular hockey games (3 periods of 20 minutes each), the speed of the clock is sped up. There are no offside or penalty calls, with one notable exception. If two players bump into each other a few times, they will start a fight. Interestingly, only the loser is sent to the penalty box. The only other enforced infraction is “Icing”. If the game is tied after the 3 periods, it moves to a shootout. The team with the most goals after 5 shots wins, and if the score is still tied, the shootout continues until there is a winner.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 7,7,6,4 stating, \"...fast action with little or no smudging on the screen, combined with games within the game that include fight scenes, make Blades a winner...\"</p>",

This is done by dropping and rotating blocks that consist of two \"pipe pieces\", which can either be straight or a bend. A pipe piece needs to have a block directly underneath it, otherwise it will fall until it is supported (meaning that blocks can split), during which time it can be rotated again. Water runs in the path created by the linking of blocks, similar to Pipe Dream.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Gorby</h2><p style=\"\">The titular character Gorby is the nickname of the USSR's President at the time, Mikhail Gorbachev. As odd as it is to have a political figure star in a video game, this was actually done as a political propaganda tool. The Japanese government was trying to improve relations between Japan and the USSR. The pipes can be symbolism for establishing a pipeline between to two counties. Russia's oil was a big reason for both the propaganda and choice of a pipe game. Japan requested and was approved by the Soviet government to use the likeness of Gorbachev.</p>",

Players must close in the large enemy, the QIX, in a closed space without it touching the player or the lines drawn by the player. Every time the player creates a closed space, they are awarded points and the space becomes solid so the QIX can no longer pass through it. Other enemies besides the QIX exist in the form of Sparx.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">The Blue Marlin is a fishing game developed and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1008\" href=\"/hot-b-co-ltd/3010-1008\">Hot-B</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21\">NES</a> platform.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Though the ultimate goal is to catch a large marlin, that's far from the only thing on the menu. Additional large, and small, game exist which can boost the score in order to proceed to the next area. The player navigates a small fishing vessel over limited ocean real estate with a lure trailing a little bit behind. In order to initiate a bite, the lure must hover over a swimming shadow in the water. However, if the boat itself drives over a shadow, the animal or animals will scatter.</p><p style=\"\">There are several shadow types to contend with as well as other factors. The most common are the schools of fish which are what the marlin feed on. Follow a school of fish long enough, and a larger shadow could appear behind them which could be a marlin. When the large shadow does appear behind a school, the goal is to maneuver your vessel in a way that the lure is over the large shadow but the vessel isn't scaring the fish away. This can be done either by stopping completely in front of the school and hoping the fish don't bite, or by maneuvering the boat just in front of the fish and slowly moving until the large shadow bites.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to those shadows, there are also whale shadows (which cannot be fished, obviously) and flocks of seagulls. Following either of these things tends to lead to a school of fish or even a lone large shadow.Though the large shadows are marlin-shaped, they aren't necessarily marlins. They can also be swordfish, tuna, or even a great white shark (which can be trouble because they take long to catch and aren't worth much, so they eat up your time)</p><p style=\"\">Once a bit has been initiated, the player comes to another screen with a visual of the fisherman and a visual of the catch in the water( for fish, its just splashes, for any kind of marlin or sworddfish, its a large fin, and for a shark its a shark fin. Both marlins and sharks have their own music themes) in addition to a meter measuring the fish's strength as well as one measuring the tightness of the line.</p><p style=\"\">The goal is to real in the fish without breaking the line. The player can both reel in and let out line in order to keep it from breaking and tire out the fish enough to reel it in. Typically the fight of the fish correlates with the size but some, like barracudas, can put up a lot of fight and turn out to be worthlessly small and timewasting. Once the time is up or a fish has been caught that is large enough to weigh in, the player will be returned to port.</p><p style=\"\">If the biggest catch and others add up to enough points, the player will be promoted to the next area. There are nine areas total, with 3 open at the start and the next 3 opened after scoring enough points. It is not required to go to every port in order to complete the game.</p>",

      "deck": "The second 16-bit game featuring Cheetos' mascot Chester Cheetah. A game that teaches us all about life, liberty, and the health benefits of orange, cheese flavored puffed corn treats.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild West is the second of two games for the Super Nintendo and Genesis based on the radical feline Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah. Like the first, <a href=\"/chester-cheetah-too-cool-to-fool/3030-13609\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13609\">Too Cool to Fool</a>, Wild Wild West is a side-scrolling platformer that pits Chester Cheetah against his old nemesis Mean Eugene the zookeeper as well as various other less-than-cool humans and animals. He can collect one-use items that will help him survive, and the player can determine which stage he visits next via a map of the USA.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">Well, it finally happened. Chester Cheetah escaped captivity at the zoo and was cruising down the road on his awesome motorcycle following his map to Hip City. Suddenly, Mean Eugene stole his map, ripped it to pieces, and scattered them across the United States. He needs to recover all the pieces by travelling the breadth of the continent, avoiding Mean Eugene all the while. Because, after all...it's not easy being cheesy.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390596-1113140885_05.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390596\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390596-1113140885_05.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390596\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3564/390596-1113140885_05.gif\"></a><figcaption>Chester on the way to 7-Eleven for some Cheetos</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The gameplay in Wild Wild Quest is fairly different than its prequel. The mechanics and sprites are completely redone and, in most cases, of much higher quality. For example, the artists went through the trouble to put shading on things.</p><p style=\"\">Now that he's out of the zoo Chester has decided to add a bit of pep to his walk and goes at about twice the speed that he did in Too Cool to Fool. Chester can also dash without the need for a power-up and perform super jumps. Chester is a fragile kitty though and will die after one hit if he isn't carrying a bag of Cheetos Brand Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p style=\"\">Levels are selected from a level select screen modeled on a US map. The player chooses a starting level and from there can choose from the level to the left or right of the level they just played.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390591-1113140884_04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390591\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390591-1113140884_04.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390591\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3564/390591-1113140884_04.gif\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">In each level Chester must find the map piece before the timer runs out. Once the map piece is found Chester has to find his way to the \"GOAL\" sign at the end of the level. Each level has a bizarre boss fight after the player reaches the goal.</p><ul><li><b>Euphreaka</b>: Located in Northern California this beachy level is filled with palm trees, vultures and a very angry fat beach lady.</li><li><b>Quakers-Field</b>: This Californian town is filled with orchards, junked cars and buildings of questionable sturdiness.</li><li><b>Omahog</b>: A farm level based in Nebraska.</li><li><b>Lostin</b>: This town in Massachusetts is filled to the brim with water, pirates and ships.</li><li><b>Numb</b>: Chester makes his way up north to Alaska to slide around on the ice and enjoy the auroras.</li><li><b>Wall Up</b>: New Mexico's finest sombrero'd cacti watch as Chester runs through this desert.</li><li><b>Little Shock</b>: Chester must navigate his way through this power plant in the heart of Arkansas.</li><li><b>Un-Clearwater</b>: Will Florida's swamps thwart Chester's need for a map piece?</li><li><b>Not-So-Great-Falls</b>: Lots of hyphens don't keep this mountainous Montana level down.</li><li><b>Rally</b>: Once Chester gets all of the map pieces he makes his way to North Carolina to beat Mean Eugene in a NASCAR race. This is less of a level and more of a final boss stage.</li></ul><h2>Collectibles</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390605-1113140886_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390605\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3564/390605-1113140886_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390605\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3564/390605-1113140886_00.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3564/390605-1113140886_00.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's almost like this game is an ad for Cheetos or something...</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Cheeto Paw</b>: Levels are filled with Cheeto paws of all sizes. Although they are counted, they don't give you any extra lives, just lots of points.</li><li><b>Bag of Cheetos</b>: Unlike Too Cool to Fool, this game actually contains Cheetos. If Chester is carrying a bag of these he won't die when he gets hit by an enemy.</li><li><b>Map Piece</b>: One in each level, Chester needs this to finish a level.</li><li><b>Friend Icon</b>: There are several icons in each level representing one of Chester's animal friends. They give you points.</li></ul><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores 6,9,8,8 stating, \"...Great animations, especially the guitar playing, along with a decent quest and a lot of different levels to keep the game rockin'. A definite winner\".</p>",

      "deck": "A sequel to the arcade classic featuring Pac-Man's feminine counterpart. The game is notable for having a variety of mazes as opposed to the single maze design in the original game, as well as bonus items that wandered through the mazes rather than appearing just in the center.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3413/221693-ms_pacman_namco.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221693\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1.375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3413/221693-ms_pacman_namco.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221693\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3413/221693-ms_pacman_namco.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from <a href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco</a>, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at <a href=\"/general-computer-corporation/3010-3474\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3474\">General Computer Corporation</a>. The programmers took a <a href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man</a> cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.</p><p style=\"\">The programmers showed it to <a href=\"/midway-games/3010-185\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway</a> who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.</p><p style=\"\">Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.</p><ul><li>The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.</li><li>The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from <a href=\"/clyde/3005-320\" data-ref-id=\"3005-320\">Clyde</a> to <a href=\"/sue/3005-4073\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4073\">Sue</a>.</li><li>The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.</li><li>The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.</li><li>The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.</li><li>The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.</li><li>The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls).</li></ul>",

Only garnering an official release in Japan, Radia Senki puts players in the shoes of an amnesiac protagonist who can be named. While in search of his own memories, the protagonist soon encounters other characters such as Darth, a man out for revenge, and a mysterious princess and together they roam the game world in search of answers to various questions that plague their lives. As per the times in Tecmo's development antics, the game features cinematic cutscenes and musical stylings similar to that of their critically-acclaimed <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1653\" href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3030-1653\" slug=\"ninja-gaiden\"> Ninja Gaiden</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/1846113-radia_senki___reimei_hen__j__201107232006189.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1846113\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/429/1846113-radia_senki___reimei_hen__j__201107232006189.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1846113\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/429/1846113-radia_senki___reimei_hen__j__201107232006189.png\"></a><figcaption> Radia Senki's command interface, which affects the behavior of other party members.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">Radia Senki features gameplay mechanics that are unconventional for its period, only being commonly adopted in strategy RPGs and other game types in later hardware generations. While there are fundamental RPG components in place such as equipment, shops, town exploration, and experience points, the actual combat takes place in real-time. The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as <a href=\"../../final-fantasy/61-8403/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Final Fantasy</a>. Experience points are also gained in real-time as each character defeats enemies. When battles have concluded, the player receives complimentary items before being whisked back to the point on the map where they were walking prior to the fighting.</p>",

The trap blocks represent a certain trap via a picture, but they all do the same thing: knock the pursuing burglar out for a short amount of time. Traps can be set anywhere in- or outside the house. After a few uses the traps break. The game also shows the player a map of where they set up traps, however it does not show where the burglars are. After 20 minutes are up the game cuts to an image of the robbers being taken away by the cops.</p>",

The game was a departure from previous brawlers with its introduction of <a href=\"/rpg-elements/3015-3603\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3603\">RPG elements</a>, <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a> <a href=\"/exploration/3015-767\" data-ref-id=\"3015-767\">exploration</a>, and <a href=\"/sandbox/3015-453\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> gameplay, anticipating later sandbox games like <a href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\">Grand Theft Auto</a>.</p><p style=\"\">In <i>Ransom</i>, the player takes control of Alex (Kunio) and Ryan (Riki), who must cross River City to reach gang leader \"Slick\" barricaded inside River CIty High. Gameplay is in the style of classic <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling</a> brawlers, namely <a href=\"/double-dragon/3030-20752\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20752\">Double Dragon</a> and Technos' own <a href=\"/renegade/3030-18293\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18293\">Renegade</a>, released the year before. Unique to River CIty Ransom is the ability to collect money from defeated enemies and spend it at shops to regain health or boost <a href=\"/attributes/3015-1681\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\">RPG-style stats</a>. The player learns new moves and increases their fighting prowess through this system. The game's quirky style of comedy also sets it apart from similar titles - and it could almost be considered a parody of them.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Players choose to control Alex or Ryan (or both in two-player <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-operative</a>). Both characters have identical skills, and differ only in appearance. The A button will punch, the B button will kick, and both pressed together will jump. Punches are faster while kicks have longer range, and the two attacks can be improved separately through use of purchased items.</p><p style=\"\">Two-player mode features both players on screen at the same time. Players can even do certain co-op moves together, including picking up the other player and throwing him into enemies. In nearly all versions, two-player comes with an A and a B mode. In A mode, players can damage each other with their strikes. In B mode, they cannot.</p><p style=\"\">As with other brawlers, various weapons can be picked up from within the environment or taken off stunned foes. Weapons include pipes, chains, <a href=\"/brass-knuckles/3055-1157\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1157\">knuckle dusters</a>, garbage cans, and even enemies that have been knocked down. Bashing an enemy overhand with the body of another enemy is part of the game's goofy humor. When holding weapons, the A button strikes with that weapon and B throws it directly forward.</p><p style=\"\">River City has seven major areas, most based around shopping centers. There is no <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> map, but players can freely return to previous areas by retracing their steps. Major areas often lead to smaller areas by pressing \"Up\" in front of alleyways in the background art. These smaller areas act as arenas for the game's bosses, who appear when specific conditions are met. The exception is the final area, River City High, which is made up of three floors plus a final battle on the roof.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191133\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191133\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7277/191133-river_city_ransom_nes_screenshot4.gif\"></a><figcaption>River City shop.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Shopping malls feature stores in the background, which can be entered by pressing \"Up\" in front of their doors. Money collected off defeated foes can be spent in the shops. Players can buy food, drinks, and medicine to refill health and boost stats. More than one \"serving\" of an item can be bought, and more expensive items will always have a larger effect. Most foods are eaten immediately inside the shop, but some can be ordered \"to go\" - allowing them to be taken along and used within the world from the inventory screen.</p><p style=\"\">Aside from food items, shops will sell books and shoes. Comic books and magazines will boost stats, while certain special books teach new attacks. The \"Stone Hands\" book, for example, upgrades the player's standard punch to a quick succession of three (for three times the damage). The \"Dragon Feet\" book does the same for kicks. Naturally, these books are very expensive. Shoes boost a combination of kicking power and agility, and are equipped from the inventory screen. They bestow their effects for as long as they are worn.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655863\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 258px\" data-ratio=\"0.62790697674419\" data-width=\"258\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655863\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655863-status.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Status screen.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Stats are tracked for each of the player characters, and can be viewed in the Status screen. Abilities start at 15 and can be increased (through food and books) to a maximum of 63. Health can be increased to a maximum of 127. The available stats are:</p><ul><li><strong>Punch</strong> - Punching strength</li><li><strong>Kick</strong> - Kicking strength</li><li><strong>Weapon</strong> - Strength of weapon attacks</li><li><strong>Throw</strong> - Damage (not distance) done by thrown objects</li><li><strong>Agility</strong> - Speed and jumping height</li><li><strong>Defense</strong> - Damage reduced by blocking (by holding A or B)</li><li><strong>Strength</strong> - Ability to break an enemy's block.</li><li><strong>Will</strong> <strong>Power</strong> - Recover from being knocked down.</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong> - Current health (restored with food)</li><li><strong>Max</strong> <strong>Power</strong> - Maximum health (boosted with books)</li></ul><p style=\"\">Each area in River City is controlled by one of nine different gangs, who increase in difficulty as the player goes along. Gang-appropriate names are reused for each member the player fights (ex: Biff, Trip, and Tyler for the \"Frat Guys\" gang), and each gang is easily distinguished by their unique colors. Gangs have different stats and tendencies (Cowboys like to double-team, Jocks favor using weapons), and also drop different amounts of cash for each member's defeat (from $.50 per defeated member up to $1.25 with the toughest gang).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197833\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 248px\" data-ratio=\"0.90725806451613\" data-width=\"248\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-197833\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2501/197833-river_city_ransom.gif\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Bosses also feature prominently, and generally appear in specific areas after the player has beaten up enough of their gang. Bosses take a lot of punishment and dish it out as well, and feature different strategies (similar to their gang) along with occasional unique moves. There are eight boss fights around River City that must be discovered and won before the player is allowed entry into River City High. From there, five more boss fights must be won inside the school, including taking down the mastermind Slick.</p><p style=\"\">Aside from the stats, another RPG aspect is a limited inclusion of dialogue. Some characters can be spoken to instead of fought with, and bosses will often provide clues. Dialogue runs along the bottom of the screen, and ranges from taunts to enemy groans when defeated (including the notorious \"BARF!\"). Status messages are also updated here, notifying the player when they collect money and when entering a new area. The options screen changes the speed at which these messages are displayed and cleared.</p><p style=\"\">Progress is saved with a password system, storing only the player's stats. Money earned and bosses defeated are not saved, so the player must start over each time, though with a much stronger character. The password is updated as the game is played, and viewable from the menu screen.</p><h2>Localization</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655861\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.69950738916256\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1655861\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1655861-monogatari_box.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Famicom Box Art</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As with the previous two games in the series, most of the changes for the Western release involved alterations to the Japanese idea of high-school rivalries (which is not the same in the West). Kunio and Riki were renamed to Alex and Ryan, and all characters' high school uniforms were changed to generic street clothes - making the enemies affiliated more to urban gangs than rival schools.</p><p style=\"\">Cover art was similarly changed. The Japanese cover reflects the Kunio-kun series' goofy delinquency and anime style. The Western covers were redrawn to portray the protagonists as more 1950s tough guy American stereotypes.</p><h2>Ports/Remakes</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1656824-x68000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656824\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 255px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1656824-x68000.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656824\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1656824-x68000.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1656824-x68000.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X68000 gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The first port of Downtown Nekketsu Monogatari was released in April, 1990 for the <a href=\"/sharp-x68000/3045-95\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000</a>, a Japanese home computer popular for its mostly identical arcade ports. This version features sharper graphics and somewhat smoother gameplay compared to the Famicom version, as well as more enemies on screen at once (three at a time is now standard, instead of two at a time on the Famicom). The X68000 version also adds new areas to River CIty, giving each gang their own high school and expanding the roster of bosses (who must all still be defeated to enter River City HIgh).</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1656771-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656771\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.93359375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/117445/1656771-2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1656771\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1656771-2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/117445/1656771-2.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>PC Engine gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In December, 1993, <a href=\"/naxat-soft/3010-868\" data-ref-id=\"3010-868\">Naxat</a> released a version in Japan for the <a href=\"/turbografx-cd/3045-53\" data-ref-id=\"3045-53\">PC Engine</a> Super CD-ROM.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Wizards &amp; Warriors, developed by Rare, was released in December of 1987 for the NES. The game stars Kuros, a powerful knight who enters the woods of Elrond in a quest to defeat the wizard Malkil. The game is depicted in 2D but has an open-world aspect to it, requiring that Kuros find a sufficient number of coins throughout the stage in order to proceed to the next. He can also acquire equipment that provides permanent boosts to various stats by finding the right keys and chests.</p><p style=\"\">The game was followed by two sequels for the NES: 1989's <a href=\"/ironsword-wizards-warriors-ii/3030-12176\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12176\">Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors II</a> and 1992's <a href=\"/wizards-warriors-iii-kuros-visions-of-power/3030-1814\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1814\">Wizards &amp; Warriors III: Kuros Visions of Power</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506143-wizards___warriors_14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506143\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506143-wizards___warriors_14.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506143\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506143-wizards___warriors_14.png\"></a><figcaption>Title Screen</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Legend says that a powerful wizard named Malkil has has gone completely mad during his years and turned his powerful magic to the dark side. Malkil has his base in Castle IronSpire where he has imprisoned a young and beautiful princess.</p><p style=\"\">It is up to the brave knight Kuros to save the princess and defeat Malkil once and for all. In order to do this, Kuros must make his way through 8 unique levels, while collecting items and defeating enemies along the way.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">While the eight main levels must be tackled linearly, the gameplay within them is more open-ended. The primary goal in each level is to collect enough gems to bribe the guardian knight, a mysterious character who guards the entrance to the next area. Gems can be found within treasure chests or items, hidden within secret areas, or just lying on the ground. Occasionally, gems also appear upon defeating enemies. Once enough gems have been collected, the guardian knight allows passage to the exit, where Kuros must defeat a deadly boss enemy to complete the level.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506159-wizards___warriors_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506159\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506159-wizards___warriors_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506159\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506159-wizards___warriors_28.png\"></a><figcaption>Forest of Elrond</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In order to collect enough gems to pass the guardian, Kuros must find and use a number of special items, the most important of which are the three keys hidden within each level. These color-coded keys (blue, pink, and red) correspond to doors and treasure chests of the same color. Finding one key usually opens a door that leads to the next, and so on. By the time all three keys are collected, Kuros usually has enough gems to clear the level. Keys cannot be carried from one area to the next, so the process begins anew with each new level.</p><p style=\"\">There are also a number of items available which bestow special abilities to Kuros. These special items are hidden away in treasure chests, and unlike keys, can be retained permanently. Examples of these items are the Dagger of Throwing and the Battle Axe of Agor, which add long-range attacks to Kuros' arsenal; the Potion of Levitation and Feather of Feather Fall, which greatly bolster his jumping and falling actions, respectively; and the Wand of Wonder and Staff of Power, which grant the ability to perform special magical attacks. In addition to these, there are also a number of other unique items hidden away with the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506176-wizards___warriors_15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506176\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506176-wizards___warriors_15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506176\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506176-wizards___warriors_15.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506176-wizards___warriors_15.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ice Caves</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">While platforming elements play a huge role in gameplay, Kuros must also contend with a whole bestiary of relentless foes. In fact, the attacks come so often, there is almost never a single moment throughout the course of the entire game in which Kuros is not defending himself. In most games, this constant onslaught would be cause for great frustration. And in fact, Wizards &amp; Warriors would very likely not be remembered fondly by anyone if not for one merciful feature - the inclusion of infinite \"continues\". Any time Kuros loses his last life, the game can be continued from that exact spot. The only repercussion is a loss of points - everything else in his arsenal (keys, gems, items) is retained. Run-of-the-mill by today's standards, but in the NES era it was a godsend to gamers who were likely all too familiar with the dreaded \"game over\" screen.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506202-wizards___warriors_50.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506202\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/506202-wizards___warriors_50.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506202\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506202-wizards___warriors_50.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/506202-wizards___warriors_50.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Showdown</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Wizards &amp; Warriors is acclaimed for its atmospheric soundtrack.

Originally released for the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System</a> in Japan on September 26, 1986, Castlevania is the first installment of the long-running <a href=\"/castlevania/3025-86\" data-ref-id=\"3025-86\">Castlevania</a> franchise. The player takes control of heroic vampire hunter <a href=\"/simon-belmont/3005-86\" data-ref-id=\"3005-86\">Simon Belmont</a>, heir to the mighty <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3055-284\" data-ref-id=\"3055-284\">Vampire Killer</a> whip, who must battle through a decrepit and unholy castle in the year 1691 to destroy the evil <a href=\"/dracula/3005-348\" data-ref-id=\"3005-348\">Count Dracula</a>. The story of the <a href=\"/belmont-clan/3015-4848\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4848\">Belmont clan</a>, the Vampire Killer whip, and Dracula's countless resurrections have grown with subsequent installments to the Castlevania franchise.</p><p style=\"\">It is often incorrectly assumed that the <a href=\"/msx/3045-15\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2</a> version of this game, known as <a href=\"/vampire-killer/3030-290\" data-ref-id=\"3030-290\">Vampire Killer</a>, is the series' first entry; this is because Vampire Killer was the first Castlevania game to be released outside of Japan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Simon's primary weapon is the Vampire Killer, which starts as a short-range leather <a href=\"/whip/3055-327\" data-ref-id=\"3055-327\">whip</a>. It can be upgraded to a <a href=\"/flail/3055-1260\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1260\">flail</a>-style chain whip with increased damage by collecting a whip <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-up</a>. The chain whip can be further upgraded by collecting a second power-up to extend its range. Simon can only crack his whip straight ahead to attack enemies with it; however, he can whip while jumping to strike at mid-air targets.</p><p style=\"\">By collecting <a href=\"/heart/3055-142\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">Hearts</a>, Simon can use one of five <a href=\"/secondary-weapons/3015-3303\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3303\">sub-weapons</a> that can be found by whipping candles or as item drops from defeated enemies. The Dagger is extremely weak, slow, and is more of a hindrance than a help. The Axe is thrown in an upward arc, useful for taking out enemies hiding or flying above Simon. The Holy Water is a short-range \"firebomb\" that can stop enemies in their tracks while doing constant damage. The Cross is a boomerang that covers the entire distance of the screen when thrown. Lastly, the Stopwatch stops all regular enemies in their tracks at a cost of five hearts. All the weapons but the Stopwatch can also be upgraded to a double and triple shot, allowing multiple uses of the weapon at the same time.</p><p style=\"\">This initial incarnation of Simon also set a standard of stiff movement for Castlevania protagonists. Simon moves at a fixed pace and cannot change his direction in mid-air after a jump. His slow speed is further reduced while climbing stairs, which can leave Simon extremely vulnerable to projectiles or fast-moving enemies. There is a slight delay during jumps between the button press and the corresponding on-screen action; this delay forces the player to be very deliberate while jumping because it requires a particular timing. The restrictive nature of Simon's jump was changed in the <a href=\"/super-castlevania-iv/3030-11443\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11443\">Super Castlevania IV</a> remake, allowing players to alter Simon's direction while in mid-air.</p><h2>Ports, Re-Releases, and Recreations</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724200\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-724200\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/724200-986756594_00.gif\"></a><figcaption>The IBM-PC port displayed with CGA graphics</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The original NES Castlevania had many ports and re-releases to various computer systems, game consoles, mobile devices, and arcade hardware.

The NES release was also ported to the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> by Nintendo on October 25, 2004 as part of the <a href=\"/classic-nes-series/3015-3653\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3653\">Classic NES Series</a>, released on the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in November 15, 2002 as a compilation of NES Castlevania and <a href=\"/contra/3025-605\" data-ref-id=\"3025-605\">Contra</a> games (dubbed <a href=\"/konami-collectors-series-castlevania-contra/3030-17939\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17939\">Konami Collector's Series: Castlevania &amp; Contra</a> ), and released on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> as a downloadable <a href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87\" data-ref-id=\"3045-87\">Wii Virtual Console</a> title on April 30, 2007 for 500 Wii Points ($5).</p><p style=\"\">In the early 1990s, Castlevania was ported to the PC, the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> (both by Unlimited Software) and the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Commodore Amiga</a> (by Novotrade). In February 5, 1993, the NES version was released in Japan (prior to that, it had only been released on the FDS), sacrificing the saving and name registration for a new \"Easy\" mode, which gives Simon more time, damage protection, lives, and knockback protection from being damaged. The game was ported to mobile phones three times, each with improved graphics (one in 2002, one in 2004, and one in 2005).</p><p style=\"\">Castlevania, along with having many ports and re-releases, has also had many recreations spanning a variety of game consoles.

It is the first game in the <a href=\"/metal-gear/3025-5\" data-ref-id=\"3025-5\">Metal Gear</a> series of action-adventure games.</p><p style=\"\">Set in 1995 <a href=\"/south-africa/3035-2839\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2839\">South Africa</a>, players control a rookie operative (codenamed <a href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">\"Solid Snake\"</a>) in an elite United States <a href=\"/special-forces/3015-3536\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3536\">special forces</a> unit called <a href=\"/foxhound/3015-447\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND</a>, as he infiltrates a fortified militaristic compound (known as <a href=\"/outer-heaven/3035-330\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven</a>) to both rescue top agent <a href=\"/gray-fox/3005-901\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">\"Gray Fox\"</a> and destroy a new, mysterious superweapon known as <a href=\"/metal-gear/3055-28\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear</a>. He must use a variety of weapons (such as a <a href=\"/silencer/3055-489\" data-ref-id=\"3055-489\">silenced</a> <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol</a>, a <a href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher</a>, and <a href=\"/c4/3055-896\" data-ref-id=\"3055-896\">C4 explosives</a>) and gadgets (such as <a href=\"/binoculars/3055-628\" data-ref-id=\"3055-628\">binoculars</a>, <a href=\"/thermal-visor/3055-1042\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1042\">thermal goggles</a>, and a <a href=\"/cardboard-box/3055-4\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4\">cardboard box</a> disguise) to progress through the compound, rescuing members of the nearby <a href=\"/resistance/3015-2542\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2542\">resistance</a> along the way. Throughout the game, Snake can gain assistance with his portable <a href=\"/radio/3055-1397\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1397\">transceiver</a>, in which he communicates with his commander (<a href=\"/big-boss/3005-475\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss</a>) and key members of the resistance.</p><p style=\"\">While the original game was never released in North America, the game was later ported to to the <a href=\"/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (which was released worldwide in 1987-1988). This port includes an updated level design, including a brand new outdoor prologue segment. It was also ported to <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC MS-DOS</a> computers and the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> in 1990, and to mobile phones in 2004 (2008 in North America).</p><p style=\"\">An updated version of the original game (alongside the official sequel, <a href=\"/metal-gear-2-solid-snake/3030-723\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a>) was included as a bonus in <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence/3030-10267\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10267\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</a> for the <a href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2</a> (with a re-translated English script, a new difficulty setting, and an unlockable <a href=\"/boss-rush/3015-1465\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1465\">Boss Survival</a>). This version was also included in the Metal Gear Solid 3 part of <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection/3030-35508\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35508\">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a> for the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Metal Gear is considered to be one of the very first <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> games, and the gameplay reflects that. The game was played from a <a href=\"/top-down-perspective/3015-788\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top down perspective</a> where the player had direct control over Snake. The emphasis of the game was on moving through the environment without being detected by the enemies rather than focusing on combat. This is reflected in the weapons that Snake uses, which tend to be <a href=\"/silencer/3055-489\" data-ref-id=\"3055-489\">silenced</a>, and are used to clear obstacles such as hollow walls or electrified floors. The only time that the player is forced to fight enemies is if they are spotted, or in order to defeat the game's <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/276/667896-metal_gear_07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667896\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88235294117647\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/276/667896-metal_gear_07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667896\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/276/667896-metal_gear_07.png\"></a><figcaption>Binoculars work in an interesting way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The player can also pick up and interact with objects in the levels. This comes in the form of obtaining <a href=\"/ammunition/3015-3761\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3761\">ammunition</a> or rations from defeated enemies, and colored <a href=\"../../color-coded-key/93-233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">key cards</a> used to open locked doors. The game also has a <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">level system</a>, where if Snake rescues <a href=\"/hostages/3015-367\" data-ref-id=\"3015-367\">hostages</a>, he gains a rank, which increases his maximum health, and carry capacity. For every 5 hostages the play rescues, they gain a rank, but they will lose a level if they allow a hostage to die.</p><p style=\"\">Metal Gear is also known for pioneering the concept of an ' <a href=\"../../alert/92-1606/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alert Mode</a>'. When the player is spotted, the game switches to Alert Mode, where the player must try to escape or kill those that have seen them. If the player is seen and a single <a href=\"/exclamation-mark/3015-818\" data-ref-id=\"3015-818\">!</a> appears <a href=\"../../punctuation-mark-over-the-head/92-4035/\" rel=\"nofollow\">above the enemies head</a>, then the game enters into a level 1 alert. In this mode, the player can escape the alert by simply moving to a different screen, or by killing the enemies in that screen. However if the player is spotted and two !! appear over an enemies head, then the game enters into a level 2 alert and not only will enemies in the screen attack the player, but off screen reinforcements will attack as well. In this mode, simply moving to an adjacent screen will not suffice; they can only end the alert by killing all incoming enemies, or by leaving the building they are in and going outside, or by moving up or down a floor in the building.</p><h2>Version Differences</h2><p style=\"\">This game was originally released on the <a href=\"/msx/3045-15\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2</a>, and this original version has fairly significant differences to the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> release. The NES release was produced without any involvement from series creator <a href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima</a>. Kojima has openly said that he is unhappy with the Metal Gear released on the NES in the US and has said it is \"complete garbage\". The game was also released on the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> and the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in the early 1990s. These versions were based on the NES version, rather than the MSX2 original.</p><h3>Specific Differences (in the NES version from the MSX)</h3><ul><li>The starting area in the NES version features a jungle instead of swimming directly into Building 1 like in the MSX version.</li><li>A lot of the music has been changed in the NES version including: Battle Theme, Intro, and Main Themes. Also, even some of the themes that were not completely changed were altered in some way (sped up or slowed down).</li><li>Basement layouts were changed or switched around.</li><li>Schneider's frequency was changed to 120.26 from 120.16.</li><li>The parachute was removed and replaced by the iron glove (which is considered by many to be useless).</li><li>The rocket rangers on the rooftop of building 1 and 2 do not have the ability to fly.</li><li>The hind D boss battle was removed and replaced by a pair of snipers - twin shot.</li><li>The trucks in the NES version are usually facing south instead of north.</li><li>The most notable difference is that players no longer fight Metal Gear at the end, but instead destroy a supercomputer which controls Metal Gears functions.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/276/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667914\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88235294117647\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/276/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667914\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/276/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/276/667914-metal_gear_17.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game is shown from a top-down perspective.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Set in 1995, Metal Gear takes place after the event of <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/3030-18082\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops/3030-14555\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14555\">Portable Ops</a>, and <a href=\"/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker/3030-26817\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26817\">Peace Walker</a>, and before the events of <a href=\"/metal-gear-2-solid-snake/3030-723\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a>. The player controls a rookie soldier codenamed <a href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">\"Solid Snake\"</a>, the newest <a href=\"/foxhound/3015-447\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND</a> Member. Snake's mission is to infiltrate <a href=\"/outer-heaven/3035-330\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven</a>, and militaristic state founded by a \" <a href=\"/big-boss/3005-475\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">legendary mercenary</a>\". The objective is to sneak in and destroy <a href=\"/metal-gear/3055-28\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear</a>, a new and mysterious weapon of mass destruction being constructed deep within Outer Heaven.</p><p style=\"\">In response to this threat, FOXHOUND sends one of their top agents <a href=\"/gray-fox/3005-901\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Gray Fox</a> to infiltrate Outer Haven and assess the situation, and deal with the threat posed by Metal Gear. However, after a few days, contact with him was lost, and the last message he sent was a mysterious transmission that simply read: \"METAL GEAR...\". The leader of FOXHOUND, <a href=\"/big-boss/3005-475\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss</a>, sends in Solid Snake to rescue Gray Fox, and complete Gray Fox's original objective, \"Operation: Intrude N313\"</p><p style=\"\">When Snake arrives in Outer Heaven, he meets local resistance members Kyle Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer, who agree to help him on his mission. Solid Snake begins his mission, and with his skills, and only using equipment procured on his mission, he manages to rescue Gray Fox. Upon rescuing him, Snake learns that Metal Gear is the codename for a walking bipedal tank armed with nuclear weapons. Outer Heaven plans to use this mobile nuclear platform to dominate the world, and install itself as the new world superpower.</p><p style=\"\">In order to learn how to stop Metal Gear, Snake seeks out and rescues Dr. Drago Pettrovich, the lead engineer of Metal Gear, as well as his daughter Ellen. Dr. Pettrovich informs Snake how to destroy Metal Gear. Armed with this knowledge Snake sneaks and fights his way through Outer Heaven to get to Metal Gear. However, Snake begins to notice that the enemy is able to track his movements with uncanny precision, and he wonders how he is being tracked so accurately.</p><p style=\"\">Never the less, Snake is able to make his way to the core of the base where Metal Gear is housed, and is able to neutralize it before it is completed. Having completed his mission, Snake begins his escape from the complex, however on his way out he is confronted by Big Boss who reveals himself to be the \"legendary mercenary\" and leader of Outer Heaven. He explains to Snake that he used his position as leader of FOXHOUND to steal military intelligence and build up his own mercenary forces, which are culminated as Outer Heaven, and the Metal Gear program. He had expected Snake to fail in his mission, since he was still just a rookie, and when he did not, he began to inform his soldiers of Snake's position, which explained why Snake was being tracked so precisely. Big Boss then starts a self-destruct sequence for the compound, stating that he won't die alone, and that Solid Snake will come with him. After a desperate battle, Snake manages to defeat Big Boss and make his escape of the compound; fleeing the base as it explodes behind him. However, after the credits of the gameplay, a message from Big Boss is displayed, saying that he will meet Snake again.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1294836-tumblr_ktzjntksiy1qaq3s8o1_500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294836\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73170731707317\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1294836-tumblr_ktzjntksiy1qaq3s8o1_500.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294836\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/1294836-tumblr_ktzjntksiy1qaq3s8o1_500.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13692/1294836-tumblr_ktzjntksiy1qaq3s8o1_500.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Solid Reese</figcaption></figure><ul><li>A still image of <a href=\"/kyle-reese/3005-14143\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14143\">Kyle Reese</a> from the movie <i>The Terminator</i> was used to create the cover art of the game.</li><li><i>\"I feel asleep!\"</i> is a famous misspelling from the Nintendo version of the game that a sleeping soldier will say when they wake up.</li></ul>",

Both players, simultaneously, select characters for their team. As there can be only one of each character used, and the players selecting <i>do not have to take turns</i>, there is an absolutely frantic meta-game in simply constructing your roster. One player could take all of the 'good' characters before the other player has even selected one. It's not uncommon for people to create 'house rules' for picking players.</p><p style=\"\">Every character has his or her own unique traits. Some are fast and some are slow. Some can hit really well and others can pitch really well. Some can teleport through a tag and others can... fly.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/98709/1415338-softball_tengoku__j___t_eng1.0_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415338\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/98709/1415338-softball_tengoku__j___t_eng1.0_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415338\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98709/1415338-softball_tengoku__j___t_eng1.0_.png\"></a><figcaption>Japanese Version</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One thing that did not make the transition from the Japanese game is, all of the characters were mythical monsters or animals. While the US version has a little creativity with a devil and a witch character, the majority of the characters are non-desrcript every day folks. Despite looking normally, all of the characters retain their original stats and powers. That makes it extremely difficult to figure out who is good at what.</p><p style=\"\">In the original version, if you see an elephant most people won't expect him to be extremely quick. When presented with a ninja, a chicken and a sumo wrestler you have the context clues to work out who'd be good at what (the ninja was quick and throws well, the chicken leaps far and catches well and the sumo wrestler annihilates the ball). While not everyone has a unique skills, there are some worth noting...</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>US</th><th>Japan</th><th>Character Power</th></tr><tr><td><b>Josh</b></td><td><i>Alien</i></td><td>Can not be tagged out when running between bases. Has to be forced out OR touch a base occupied by an opposing player with a ball.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Froggy</b></td><td><i>Frog</i></td><td>Hops as he runs, but can also move through puddles on certain fields.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Casey</b></td><td><i>Tengu</i></td><td>Instead of jumping for a ball, he'll jump and hover in the air.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stan</b></td><td><i>Chimp</i></td><td>Can climb outfield walls to steal homeruns.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Sid</b></td><td><i>Chicken</i></td><td>Can dive huge distances while playing defense.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Peter</b></td><td><i>Snowman</i></td><td>Can bat left or right handed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=\"\">While inconvenient, it does offer the occasional reward to the adventurous captain. Finding that diamond in the rough is often an achievement and is part of the charm of the game. With 60 characters to choose from, there's no shortage of combinations to try.</p><p style=\"\">While every player has his or her own favorite characters, there are some that are clearly suited for specific roles.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Player</th><th>Skills and Stats</th><th>Suggested Use</th></tr><tr><td><b>Fuji</b></td><td>Powerful hitter, incredibly slow</td><td>Catcher, First Base</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mikey</b></td><td>All-a-rounder, cannon for an arm</td><td>Short Stop, Outfield</td></tr><tr><td><b>Louis</b></td><td>Fast runner, good hands</td><td>Outfield</td></tr><tr><td><b>Slick</b></td><td>Disgustingly quick, solid pitching</td><td>Pitcher, Second Base</td></tr><tr><td><b>Diablo</b></td><td>Solid batter, little on the slow side</td><td>First Base</td></tr></tbody></table><p style=\"\">Some rules of thumb make building a team fairly simple; Slow guys at catcher and first base, fast guys in the outfield and don't get greedy with the power hitters... it never works.</p><p style=\"\">If the amount of players wasn't enough content, Dusty Diamond's All Star Softball offers an additional mode over the Japanese version; Fast Pitch vs. Slow Pitch. It's not just the speed of the ball that changes, but the overall rules. Much like real softball, when slow pitch is on teams have 4 outfielders and runners can no longer steal bases.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/98709/1415577-xdusty_diamond_s_all_star_softball__u_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415577\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/98709/1415577-xdusty_diamond_s_all_star_softball__u_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415577\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98709/1415577-xdusty_diamond_s_all_star_softball__u_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/98709/1415577-xdusty_diamond_s_all_star_softball__u_.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Field Selection</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Adding further variety to the game is your choice of 5 fields (Professional makes 6 fields in the 2 player game) each with it's own quirks and rules. The Park has a very short homerun line but no fences so outfielders can chase down extremely well hit balls. Although misplaying a pop fly can lead to easy points. The School is another field that lacks a proper wall or fence, but if you break a window you're automatically out! The Cliff is enclosed like a regular baseball diamond, but with a picket fence in left field. Hit the ball UNDER the fence for a ground rule double. The Park has water hazards, The Island has trees that can interfere with a throw and the Professional is a no-frills playing surface.</p>",

Dizzy embarks on a around the world cruise expecting the holiday of a lifetime. The YolkFolk had warned him prior to his cruise that the deal he had got must be too good to be true and in the end the YolkFolk were proved to be eggcelent in their deductions. Upon disembarking for his trip of a lifetime Dizzy noticed something was not quite right with his ship. The captain was called long john silver and there appeared to be alot of drunk pirates aboard. Dizzy in all of his wonder had managed to book a cruise on a pirate ship.<br/><br/>As time passed Dizzy learnt to enjoy the company of the pirates and started to fit in. So much so that one sunny day while the ship was stuck in shallow waters dizzy organised a game of cricket on the deck. This went down a storm with the pirates and fun was had by all. This was until they realised that Dizzy had used Long John Silvers spare wooden peg leg collection as wickets and they had now been thrown overboard in the excitement of the match.<br/><br/>In the end the inevitable happened when you go on a cruise with pirates and Dizzy was forced to walk the plank. He later washed up on a sunkissed beach with only one thing on his mind. Revenge? no. He had to get back to the YolkFolk and lodge his compensation claim, and he had to do it now!<br/><br/>This is where the adventure of Treasure island Dizzy begins.<br/><h2>Gameplay</h2>TID was at its heart a puzzle/adventure game. It had advancements over its predecessor such as a fully implemented inventory system and improved animations. The addition of the inventory led to a new style of gameplay for the Dizzy series. Gameplay focused less on defeating enemies and more on solving puzzles with inventory items. Dizzy's main aim in the game was to construct a boat so he could sail home.<br/><br/>TID is without doubt one of the most difficult Dizzy games as the game featured no health bar and you only had one life. Another feature that made the game hideously difficult was that the inventory management could be described as \"insane\"  the only interaction you had with your inventory was pressing enter which made dizzy put down an item in the inventory. Which item however was out of your control as dizzy always just put down the item at the top of the list. This meant that you could be swimming underwater and tap enter dizzy would put down his snorkel  item and instantly drown to death. It could be argued Dizzy was not the brightest. This forced the player to think ahead massively when it came to having to use items in the inventory.<br/><br/>Other issues which made the game difficult was that the game featured a side quest that had to be completed to leave the island. This side quest was only explained to the player however just as they were about to leave the island and, as far as the player was concerned, finish the game. This side quest involved going back through the island and collecting 30 coins which where hidden behind scenery.",

      "description": "<b></b><h2><b>History</b></h2><b><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Sky Shark is a vertical-scrolling shooting game in which you take command of a biplane and shoot enemies all around you. It was developed by the company Toaplan and published by Taito in 1987. It was previously called Flying Shark, but was released under the name Sky Shark in the US and was licensed to Romstar for distribution. It was also converted to  the amiga, Commodore 64, DOS, ZX spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, FM Towns, and Nintendo Entertainment System.<br /><br />There was a sequel, Fire Shark. It was released for the Sega Megadrive and Arcade in 1990 and is called Same! Same! Same! in Japan.</span><br /><br /><br /></b><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><b><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\">Sky Shark puts you in control of a biplane and makes you take out enemy planes, turrets, tanks and other land bases. The game starts you off with three lives and three bombs. For every one thousand points you get it rewards you with a life. If you make it to the base where you land your plane, the base racks up your points and if you haven't used any bombs it rewards you with an extra one. The game also consists of special power pick ups. You can get these pick ups by destroying a formation of enemy planes which come at you in V shape formations or criss cross style. If you manage to destroy the entire formation they release an S power up that makes you fire extra bullets. If you manage to destroy a formation of yellow enemy planes, you are given an extra 1000 points. <br /><br /></span></b><div><b><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"></span></b><h3><b>Controls</b></h3><b><br />The controls are really simple. The D pad maneuvers the plane, while the B button makes you drop bombs on enemies. But the bombs have a limit, so you have to use them wisely. Mainly on big ships or swarms of enemy planes. While the A button makes  you shoot bullets out of your plane and are unlimited which you can pretty much mash mindlessly.</b></div>",

It was then that the first of the Elden people arrived along the shore of the Great Sea. At first, the native people of the land attacked the newcomers, seeing them as a threat. After a century of war, the Kingdom of Albareth unified the land and began to prosper. The Elden earned the respect of the people that had once called them enemies and seven hundred years ago, an Elden prince was named the first High King of Albareth with the people's blessing. <br /> <br />He had also brought three powerful relics from the homeland of the Elden: the Tablet of Truth, the Foretelling Stones, and the Golden Medallion of Power. The Tablet allowed the king to answer any question of import to the kingdom and only an Elden of the purest blood were able to call upon it. The Warden of the Southern Marches was found worthy of keeping this great treasure. <br /> <br />The Foretelling Stones enabled the King to see places and times, aiding any who sought its wisdom. These the High King left with the Prior of Marabout, a great monastery built near Rhyder in the far North. <br /> <br />But it was the Medallion of Power that was the most sacred of these three. No High King can hold the throne without it, and its magical essence only recognizes those worthy of the title as a descendant of High King Strebor (Roberts, in reflection). The Medallion allowed the wielder to command entire armies as one force, but its strength was only as strong as the heart of the one who wore it. Therefore, only an Elden with kingly blood could bear it. <br /> <br />Peace reigned until the arrival of the Barbarians from the South. Ganestor was overrun and the armies of Albareth did all they could to break their march. Both armies fought each other for ten long years as High King Valwyn looked for a way to stop the bloodshed. <br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581029-times_of_lore_02_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581029\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581029-times_of_lore_02_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581029\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15693/581029-times_of_lore_02_1_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15693/581029-times_of_lore_02_1_.png\"></noscript></a></figure>  He then took the best of his forces and confronted the Barbarians in what would become known as the Battle of Ganestor, inflicting terrible losses on the Barbarians whose seemingly endless numbers continued to pour more soldiers into the field. It was a stalemate that neither side could break. The High King finally used the Medallion to pause the battle and parlay with Heidric, the Barbarian leader. Many days passed and at last, a treaty was hammered out. <br /> <br />Ganestor would go to the Barbarians, but in return, they were to swear fealty to the throne of Albareth. The two men grew to respect each other over time and in commemoration of the truce several years later, Valwyn presented Heidric with the Tablet of Truth. Heidric was also named the Warden of Ganestor and peace seemed guaranteed once again. <br /> <br />Valwyn was growing old and the Ten Year war had drained even more of his dwindling strength. Taking his child and the Medallion, he departed for the Elden homelands back across the sea to rest and recover his spirit, leaving the kingdom in the hands of his steward, Dariel. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Albareth, Dariel proved to be less of an able ruler than Valwyn. <br /> <br />Many Elden lords did not agree with the truce signed with Heidric and had fostered hate for him and his people over the years since. With Valwyn gone and Dariel seen as a weak replacement, these Elden lords attacked Ganestor hoping to tear it from the grip of Heidric's son, Prince Avar. <br /> <br />So it is that Dariel remains as a prisoner within the city of Eralan, fearful of his enemies and unable to stop the growing chaos festering in the land. Orcs have also been sighted coming in from the North and with Albareth's own forces stretched thin, bandits freely rob travelers on the roads in between each city.  <br /> <br />A savior was needed.<br /> <br /><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/577709-timesoflore_3_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-577709\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/577709-timesoflore_3_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-577709\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15693/577709-timesoflore_3_1_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15693/577709-timesoflore_3_1_.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure>  Starting the game presented a storybook that told the story of the kingdom of Albareth and its current troubles. Upon starting play, the character would be able to chose from one of three characters to represent them in the game:<br /><br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Stalwart Knight - armored and equipped with a sword</li><li>Fierce Valkyrie - fast and lightly armored</li><li>Powerful Barbarian - Very strong but no armor</li></ul> <br />The main character was always fixed in the center of the screen and the adventure took place in both outdoor and indoor environments. Upon walking into a building or an underground area such as cave, the \"top\" of the area would cut away to show the player and their surroundings. <br /> <br />Saves were handled only at the inn after paying for a stay. This could make the game extremely difficult due to the size of the overland map and the number of dungeons on it. Dying so far from an inn would result in quite a bit of lost progress on the player's part.<br /><br />Unlike other traditional RPGs, there are no statistics to roll or assign in the game. There is no leveling involved. Health was represented by a candle that slowly burned down on being injured. Recovery was handled either by standing still (during which health would slowly recover) or through the use of certain potions.<br /> <br />Item collection consisted of picking up potions, although only one of every type of potion was allowed to be carried. Money can also be gathered and used to purchase potions or better weapons. <br /> <br /> Interacting with the environment, the interface displayed basic actions such as picking up objects, dropping them, a \"look\" command to examine things, and a \"talk\" option to engage NPCs in simple dialogue. <br /> <br />A day and night cycle as also integrated into the gameplay. Encounters at night were considerably more difficult than during the day. Enemies would spawn while the player was in motion.<br /><br /><h2>Combat</h2>The combat is in real-time with the player controlling the main character which is fixed in the center. The player would normally walk up to monsters and use the attack button to inflict damage. Monsters would drop gold, potions, or even items.",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Wonder Boy in Monster Land is the second of the Wonder Boy series and marks the series' first foray as an action RPG, rather than a simple platformer. Future Wonder Boy games (the series would eventually be rebranded Monster World) would retain the RPG elements, while the platforming aspect would continue in the Wonder Boy \"spin-off\" series <a data-ref-id=\"3025-745\" href=\"/adventure-island/3025-745\">Adventure Island</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The goal of the game is to move Wonder Boy across the world, fighting monsters and collecting money and using that money to purchase upgrades to armor and weapons. Wonder Boy must face a significant number of bosses as well, each with varying attack patterns. Though careful platforming is a necessity, exploration and backtracking are also occasionally required if the player wishes to reach the end of the game.</p><p style=\"\">The game was released in the Arcades initially by Sega in 1987, eventually moving to their Sega Master System the following year. It was also published by Activision for many Western home computers like the Amiga, C64 and ZX Spectrum a year after that in 1989. Since then it has been rereleased several more times, first as a 2005 mobile game, then a 2008/9 Virtual Console port for the Wii (using the Sega Master System version) and most recently in 2012 as part of a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-38191\" href=\"/sega-vintage-collection-monster-world/3030-38191\">compilation</a> of Monster World games available for PSN, XBLA and Virtual Console.</p><p style=\"\">Additionally, the game received at least three major graphical overhauls which were released under different names. The first was a PC Engine port the same year as its Arcade release, renamed Bikkuriman World and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"/hudson-entertainment-inc/3010-419\">Hudson Soft</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1033\" href=\"/jaleco-ltd/3010-1033\">Jaleco</a> ported the game with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West\" rel=\"nofollow\">Journey to the West</a> graphics as Saiyuki World for the NES. Finally, the Brazilian version of the Sega Master System changed the graphics to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang. Excepting the graphical switch, each version is functionally identical to the original.</p><h2>Turbografx-16/PC-Engine Version</h2><p style=\"\">Wonder Boy in Monster Land was ported to the PC Engine system as one of its two launch titles, though it received a new title - Bikkuriman World - and an entirely new set of sprites to become part of the Bikkuriman license.</p><p style=\"\">Bikkuriman was originally a series of collectible stickers that were included with a sweet confection, sort of like the Japanese equivalent of the US's Bazooka Joe. Its popularity among children eventually led to manga and anime adaptations; the first anime adaptation coinciding with the release of the game.</p><h2>Brazilian Version</h2><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" href=\"/sega-master-system/3045-8\">Sega Master System</a> release in Brazil, a nation where the SMS retained its popularity for many years after it had been supplanted elsewhere by the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-6\" href=\"/genesis/3045-6\">Sega Genesis</a>, also received a visual makeover in a similar fashion to the Bikkuriman World port. In this case, the game's name was changed to Mônica no Castelo do Dragão and retooled to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang.</p><h2>SEGA AGES</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158170/2209138-xbox_sega_monster_world_collection_boxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2209138\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 219px\" data-ratio=\"1.3698630136986\" data-width=\"219\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/158170/2209138-xbox_sega_monster_world_collection_boxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2209138\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/15/158170/2209138-xbox_sega_monster_world_collection_boxart.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan.

He is stranded on an island when his plane crashes down and must make his way across to where a boat can be found. Between him and the boat are all the island's hostile inhabitants.</p><p style=\"\">Amagon was originally released in Japan as Totsuzen!

The player must keep track of their ammo: This is Amagon's only means of attack and should his ammunition run out he will be unable to attack enemies.</p><p style=\"\">Amagon can upgrade his strength after collecting enough points - either from defeating enemies or collecting items - and a special Megagon Key power-up. Hitting Select when these conditions are met turns him into Megagon, a considerably more powerful alter ego. Megagon can take several hits and has a powerful wave beam attack that also drops his health. When Megagon runs out of health he simply reverts back to Amagon's weaker form.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Initially released on the <a href=\"/turbografx-16/3045-55\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\">TurboGrafx-16</a>, <a href=\"/bonks-adventure/3030-6973\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6973\">Bonk</a>, or as it was known in Japan, <a href=\"/bonk/3025-68\" data-ref-id=\"3025-68\">PC-Genjin</a>, was a success and was eventually ported over to competitor consoles. In arcade versions, <a href=\"/bonk/3005-3321\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3321\">Bonk</a> would be accompanied by a female version of himself.</p><p style=\"\">In Bonk's Adventure, the player assumes the role of the caveman Bonk. The player must navigate their way through five different worlds to rescue <a href=\"/princess-za/3005-4557\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4557\">Princess Za</a>, who has been captured by the dinosaur, <a href=\"/king-drool/3005-4177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4177\">King Drool</a>. In a time when consoles had to have mascots, Bonk was the solution for the TurboGrafx-16. As a platformer it would be held in direct comparison to Mario and Sonic. Although it was a star when it came to graphics, in particular color palette, it never garnered enough popular appeal to push sales of the Turbo-Grafx.</p><p style=\"\">In November/December 2006, Bonk's Adventure was released on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii's</a> <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>. It is currently available for 600 Nintendo Points and supports all controller types. It was also added to the <a href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\">PlayStation Network</a> store in 2011.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Bonk's weapon is his large head, which can be used to defeat the various prehistoric enemies that stand in his way. While on the ground, Bonk smashes his head forward. In the air the headbutt creates a spin that, by pressing the button repeatedly, can slow Bonk's descent. Bonk is capable of juggling an opponent, gaining more points with each consecutive hit. The term <a href=\"/juggling/3015-273\" data-ref-id=\"3015-273\">juggling</a> makes particular sense in this game since each time Bonk hits the enemy from below they pop up in an arc and Bonk must run to catch them before they land. <a href=\"/lives/3015-323\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">Lives</a> are gained through score, as well as found within the world, although they are few and far between.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to prehistoric monsters there are a number of pod-like flowers that offer goodies for Bonk. Some of those goodies are fruits and vegetables that boost Bonk's score. Others contain meat, and an handful are <a href=\"/monster-chest/3015-258\" data-ref-id=\"3015-258\">hidden monsters</a> that will pop up and bounce after Bonk.</p><p style=\"\">If Bonk collects meat he evolves. There are 3 different levels for Bonk to evolve to. The first level is where he starts. The second level Bonk gets blue tints and is able to pound the ground and temporarily freeze enemies. The third level turns Bonk into an invulnerable, green tinted version of himself. This invulnerability only last a short time. Meat comes in two forms: Small meat will only transform Bonk one level whereas large meat will transform him two levels. After enough time, and without more meat, Bonk will revert back to his original self.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p style=\"\">There are 5 levels in Bonk's Adventure. Each has a number of sub-level to complete that basically requires Bonk to move to the right, jump over enemies and avoid pits and traps. Occasionally there would be doors for Bonk to enter, which would result in a mini-game. These mini-games include a vertical drop where the challenge is for Bonk to spin and eventually land on his feet; a challenge to headbutt rocks of lava that come out of a volcano, and a jumping challenge where Bonk bounces from flower to flower trying to collect the most fruit without falling into the pits below. After completing the mini-game Bonk is dropped back into the world he came from in the exact state he left it. After 8 mini-levels Bonk encounters a boss by hopping in a bizarre dinosaur skull elevator.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p style=\"\">In total there are six different bosses in the game, four of which are being controlled by King Drool. Each boss wears some sort of headgear which Bonk must destroy by headbutting it until it breaks.</p><h3>Huey</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17245/562529-bonk_s_adventure__u__010.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-562529\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17245/562529-bonk_s_adventure__u__010.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-562529\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17245/562529-bonk_s_adventure__u__010.png\"></a><figcaption>Huey, the game's first boss.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Huey is one of the enemies being brainwashed by King Drool. He blows bubbles as an attack, and requires fifteen hits to beat. After a few hits, the brainwashing helmet is damaged and on the fifteenth blow is subdued.</p><p style=\"\">\"Gee Wiz!! Thanks!! I feel a lot better. I'm your new friend. Arf Arf Arf!!\"</p><h3>Gladdis</h3><p style=\"\">Gladdis has the ability to create a clone of herself, after which Bonk must attack the real Gladdis with a head stomp. The imaginary Gladdis will jump around and throw stars, but Bonk will pass seamlessly through her. In the next phase of her pattern, Gladdis returns to a single form and teleports around the screen, shooting stars at Bonk.</p><p style=\"\">\"You're my hero!! You've won my heart and mind, Bonk!!\"</p><h3>Kongo Zilla</h3><p style=\"\">Kongo Zilla's stage takes place on <a href=\"/ice-stage/3015-2076\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2076\">icy terrain</a>, which makes handling Bonk more difficult. Kongo Zilla digs underground with his spiked arms and throws ice blocks at Bonk.</p><p style=\"\">\"You made a monkey out of me, Bonk. Come to think of it, I am a monkey! By the way, have you seen Princess Za?\"</p><h3>Punchy Pedro</h3><p style=\"\">Punchy Pedro is named for his punches. One of which is quick and the other of which does a significant amount of damage. As with all bosses, his head of the weak spot to aim for.</p><p style=\"\">\"You really rang my bell on that one. It feels great to be out in the light. Now I can find my beloved Princess!\"</p><p style=\"\">After these four bosses are beaten, Bonk will have to fight them all in succession, although Kongo Zilla won't have his icy floor to make Bonk slip.</p><h3>T. Ractor Head</h3><p style=\"\">When Bonk gets to Princess Za, he finds out that she has also been brainwashed by King Drool, and Bonk will have to fight T. Ractor Head to save her. He has all of the previous bosses' abilities, as well as a volcano which shoots rocks and homing darts. Once Bonk defeats him, Princess Za comes out of her brainwashed state.</p><p style=\"\">\"I am Princess Za from Moonland!!\"</p><p style=\"\">\"My people had been brainwashed!!\"</p><p style=\"\">\"Help me get back to Moonland!!\"</p><h3>King Drool</h3><p style=\"\">King Drool uses a shield which renders him invincible. He shoots fireballs and later dives at Bonk from the sky.</p><h2>Items</h2><p style=\"\">There are many items and <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">powerups</a> which Bonk will come across on his travels.</p><h3>Small Meat</h3><p style=\"\">One piece will give Bonk the ability to <a href=\"/ground-pound/3015-1532\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1532\">headbutt the ground</a>, <a href=\"/stun/3015-1577\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1577\">stunning</a> all nearby enemies, and two pieces will grant <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility</a>.</p><h3>Large Meat</h3><p style=\"\">Equivalent to two pieces of small meat.</p><h3>Vegetables</h3><p style=\"\">Vegetables will give 50 points, as well as regaining a small amount of health.</p><h3>Fruit</h3><p style=\"\">Fruit will give 100 points and regain twice as much health as vegetables.</p><h3>Red Heart</h3><p style=\"\">Red hearts fill up a section of health.</p><h3>Blue Heart</h3><p style=\"\">Blue hearts raise the amount of health sections by one.</p><h3>Extra Life</h3><p style=\"\">These are found sparingly through levels, but are also received every 100,000 points.</p><h3>Smiley Faces</h3><p style=\"\">Collect all of these in a level and receive an award at the end, akin to <a href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\">Super Mario World</a>'s dragon coins.</p><h2>PS Vita Compatibility</h2><p style=\"\">Despite not being in the official compatibility list, Bonk's Adventure can be played on the <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PS Vita</a>. To do this, the user must first download the game to the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PS3</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Ultima III: Exodus is the third and final game of what would be known as the \"First Trilogy\" of the Ultima Series, the \"Three Ages of Darkness\" in which the goal of the game was to defeat an evil overlord. In this game the \"evil wizard\" is Exodus, part monster, part machine. It is unclear what exactly Exodus is supposed to look like. In the game itself he/it looks like four sparkly squares, although in later games (particularly Ultima VI and VII) he is depicted as a demon similar to the one on the box cover. Ultima III was also the first Ultima game published by the newly founded Origin Systems Inc rather than Sierra On-Line. It features a much more consistent setting and tone than the previous two games, which combined sci-fi and fantasy elements.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/569528-99872_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-569528\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/569528-99872_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-569528\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/569528-99872_1_.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Ultima III is the first Ultima game to include a party system, a hallmark of the series until abandoned in Ultima VIII. Whereas in later games the player creates and takes control of one character (the Avatar) and then has others join his (or her) party, in Ultima III the play can create any number of characters and give them a wide assortment of races and classes. At the beginning of any given gaming session, the player could then select up to four of the characters and enter the world with them. Characters would keep the equipment and experience they had gained even when they were removed from the party, and so in theory the player could level-up more than four characters and pick the best four for a given situation. This feature allowed for a peculiar exploit in which the player could create any number of \"dummy\" characters and transfer their starting money and equipment to the players he or she really wanted to use and so begin in a better financial position than the designers intended. In addition, if a character was killed in the game, his or her dead state was immediately saved, regardless of whether the player \"quits and saves.\"</p><p style=\"\">Ultima III maintains the 2-D world map, the 2-D towns, and the 3-D dungeons of the previous games, and the entire party is represented by a single icon (at least in the non-console versions) on the world and town maps. Unlike in the previous games, however, combat in Ultima III (including combat in dungeons) takes place on a separate 2-D screen on which each member of the party is represented as a separate character. The enemies also travel in groups, although in Ultima III each group only consists of one kind of monster. Interestingly enough, Ultima III included as many as three different variations for each type of monster.</p><p style=\"\">Like the later games, Ultima III takes places primarily on one super-continent, although it is still Sosaria and not Britannia. It also features moongates, which allow instananeous travel to fixed places on the map, and includes Dawn, a city which is only visible (and accessible) during certain phases of the moon.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">In order to destroy Exodus, the party of adventurers must collect different marks that allow them to pass through the barriers protecting the demon. They must also collect four cards, Sol, Moon, Love, and Death. The cards are found in shrines in the lost land of Ambrosia, which is accessed by taking a ship into a whirlpool. Incidentally, the shrines also increase the players strength, wisdom, dexterity, and intelligence. Once they have collected the marks, the Exotic weapons and the cards, the adventures can sail up the Giant Earth serpent, yell the magic word, and sail up to Exodus' castle. Inside the castle the floor itself will attack them before they can find the machine and insert the cards that will destroy it.</p><h2><strong>Legacy</strong></h2><p style=\"\">The party system and the more serious fantasy setting of Ultima III definitely set the stage for the later Ultima games and many other computer role playing games. It is the last Ultima game in which the primary quest is to destroy an evil wizard-type. Later games would move in more complicated directions.</p><h2>Compatability</h2><p style=\"\">This game can be played on modern Windows operating systes with an emulator like <a href=\"http://www.dosbox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DOSBox</a>.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p style=\"\">The game is available on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\" href=\"/good-old-games/3015-2379\">gog.com</a> as part of the package Ultima 1+2+3.</p>",

It was released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom, and was the first game SunSoft - the original developers of Arabian - ever produced for the system.

Super Arabian would later appear in the Japan-exclusive 2001 PlayStation compilation Memorial Series Sunsoft Vol. 1.</p><p style=\"\">The player controls the <a href=\"/arabian/3030-22221\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22221\">Arabian</a> who must jump his way through a variety of environments in order to save the princess that has been captured by a band of crows. The only way he can safely make it though each level is to collect the letters hidden in different vases. Once he does that he may proceed to the next level.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">This is pretty much a exact copy of the game <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311\" data-ref-id=\"3030-311\">Donkey Kong</a> with a different theme. This means the Arabian can only jump over enemies rather than attack them directly and has to evade a lot in order to collect the vases scattered around each level. Each environment has a different type of object that he can climb: For instance, in the first level he has to scale the poles of the ship in order to collect everything. On level 3 he will also have to deal with flying carpets that he must scale to reach all of the letters. Once he gets past the 4 levels they will start to repeat until the player has run out of lives.</p><h3>Enemies</h3><ul><li>Small Crows: They walk around the level going up and down to stop the Arabian's progress. They will periodically fly directly at him from wherever they are in the level.</li><li>Pink Monsters: Most of the time they just go back and forth. But sometimes they will jump at the Arabian instead of letting him jump over them.</li><li>Giant Crow: He stays the the top of the screen. Going back and forth. For whatever reason he doesn't attack the Arabian unless he runs into him.</li></ul>",

      "deck": "An educational adventure game in which Mario must travel through time to restore historically significant objects that Bowser has stolen to their correct eras.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Mario's Time Machine is an educational game featuring Nintendo's mascot Mario and is part of the Mario Discovery Series, along with <a href=\"/mario-is-missing/3030-5443\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5443\">Mario is Missing!</a> and the Mario's Early Years trio. Whereas Mario is Missing! taught younger players geography, Mario's Time Machine teaches world history instead. The SNES version was developed by The Software Toolworks in late 1993, and the NES version by Radical Entertainment the following year. There are minor differences between the two versions as a result.</p><p style=\"\">The goal is to take stolen items out of Bowser's museum, time-travel to the time period from which they hail (the location and date are important when imputting coordinates) and piece together information about the artifact and its owner by talking to NPCs from that era before they can be given back.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14599/347872-marios_time_machine_snes_screenshot1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-347872\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14599/347872-marios_time_machine_snes_screenshot1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-347872\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14599/347872-marios_time_machine_snes_screenshot1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Title Screen of Mario's Time Machine</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Somehow Bowser has gotten a hold of a time machine, called the Timulator. Using the Timulator he goes back in time and steals many important artifacts of history. Bowser places all of these artifacts that he has taken into what he considers to be \"the greatest <a href=\"/museum/3035-1295\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1295\">museum</a> of all time.\" Bowser will then destroy the Timulator after he is done building his collection, and therefore change the course of history forever.</p><p style=\"\">It is up to Mario to stop Browser from completing his collection of artifacts and return them to their respected time eras. If the artifacts are not brought back history will be changed permanently.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The basic gameplay consists of players talking to historic figures and solving basic puzzles in order to return artifacts to their rightful owners. Each object in Bowser's museum has attached to it a basic explanation of a famous historical figure, including the date and location the item was taken from. By imputing these co-ordinates into the Timulator, Mario can travel back to the correct era with the item in tow.</p><p style=\"\">When travelling back in time, players play a brief <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigame</a> where Mario travels trough an endless \"ocean of time\" with many <a href=\"/whirlpool/3010-6671\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6671\">whirlpools</a>, and the objective is to grab enough <a href=\"/mushroom/3055-1236\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1236\">mushrooms</a> and deposit them into a wave pool in order to succesfully travel back in time. If Mario does not collect enough mushrooms before falling into a whirlpool or has imputed the wrong year/location combo, he travels back to the prehistoric era where he must play a version of <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3030-311\" data-ref-id=\"3030-311\">Donkey Kong</a> in order to get back to the museum where players can opt to try again.</p><p style=\"\">Once reaching the correct era, Mario can walk around and ask NPCs for hints. Most will provide at least one of the clues necessary to fill in the explanation provided with the item, and once this report is correctly filled in the item is given to its correct owner and the player can move onto the next.</p><h3>NES Version</h3><p style=\"\">The NES version is a little different from the original SNES version. In this version, Mario has to fight Koopa Troopas in platforming sequences before being allowed to travel back in time. Mario also has no idea which artifact goes in which period (the SNES version informs the player as soon as they collect one of the artifacts) and must use the NPC hints to figure out which artifact is the right one for each period.</p><h2>Historical figures</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14599/347870-edumario17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-347870\" data-size=\"large\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14599/347870-edumario17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-347870\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14599/347870-edumario17.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The historical figure that are featured in the game are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/cleopatra/3005-5296\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5296\">Cleopatra VII</a></li><li><a href=\"/queen-elizabeth/3005-3405\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3405\">Elizabeth I</a></li><li><a href=\"/ferdinand/3005-8011\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8011\">Ferdinand Magellan</a></li><li>Issac Newton</li><li><a href=\"/joan-of-arc/3005-725\" data-ref-id=\"3005-725\">Joan of Arc</a></li><li>Johann Gutenberg</li><li><a href=\"/leonardo-da-vinci/3005-3202\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3202\">Leonardo de Vinci</a></li><li>Ludwig van Beethoven</li><li><a href=\"/gandhi/3005-2186\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2186\">Mahatma Gandhi</a></li><li>Marco Polo</li><li><a href=\"/michelangelo/3005-172\" data-ref-id=\"3005-172\">Michelangelo</a></li><li>Plato</li><li>Thomas Alva Edison</li><li><a href=\"/thomas-jefferson/3005-3649\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3649\">Thomas Jefferson</a></li><li>William Shakespeare</li></ul><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When the SNES version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the review scores of 7,7,6 and 7. Danyon Carpenter wrote, \"I actually enjoyed Mario is Missing and I expected this one to be the same. Luckily, it is and it offers even more challenging quests than the first. Kiddies may have a tougher time with this one. For all you experienced gamers, the game will seem like a cakewalk, especially the Donkey Kong-like scenes and the surf boarding, but once you start reading those questions you'd better break out the history books\".</p>",

Kenshiro faces enemies that range from the bandit leader Mr. Heart all the way up to his powerful rival Raoh.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">This player controls Kenshiro moving either left or right and jumping across the five action stages. He can attack using his punches and kick and both can hit either high or low to take out the enemies. Upon killing an enemy, either one of two things would happen:</p><ul><li>If Kenshiro kicked the enemy, they are flown across the screen whilst the enemy is still kicking (this also happens if the player dies).</li><li>If Kenshiro punched the enemy, then - just like the manga/anime - the enemies would shout out \"Abeshi!\" and explode.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2375777-hokuto_no_ken__j__201211260000419.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375777\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137417/2375777-hokuto_no_ken__j__201211260000419.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2375777\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/137417/2375777-hokuto_no_ken__j__201211260000419.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Find Lynn to enter the correct door</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Initially the enemies can be killed with just one punch but later on, they require two hits and eventually three hits to kill them.

A small picture of <a href=\"/lynn/3005-24874\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24874\">Lynn</a> appears on the door to show the right way to the boss.

      "deck": "A video game adaptation loosely based on the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Kevin is accidentally flown to New York on his own and must avoid local perils as well as the persistent \"Sticky Bandits\" Harry and Marv.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Though based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was in ways worlds different from the movie. Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.</p><p style=\"\">The SNES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the SNES' traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.</p><h3>Levels</h3><p style=\"\"><u><b>Level 1 - The Plaza Hotel</b></u></p><p style=\"\">Kevin's first entry to New York is the Plaza Hotel, where his father's stolen credit card helps pay the way for a nice, posh room and ideal room service. But after the hotel workers discover his ruse, he attempts to escape.</p><p style=\"\">Kevin leaps out of the hotel and right into the arms of his old enemies Marv and Harry, who, as well as escaping from prison and attempting to rob the Christmas toy store, have a bone to pick with Kevin and take him away. But after a quick goose on a woman, who in turn socks Marv, Kevin escapes into the confines of Central Park.</p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Level 2 - Central Park</b></u></p><p style=\"\">One of New York's most popular tourist attractions, Central Park is a haven for both glamour (in the daytime) and filth (at night). Kevin enters the park at one of the worst times, having to contend with vermin and urban leeches.</p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Level 3 - The Uncle's House</b></u></p><p style=\"\">Kevin knew he had an uncle who lived in New York and, after much searching, finds his house, noticing it in a state of disrepair and decay. Stones and plaster drop from the ceiling, there are holes in the floors, and several of the doors to get out are locked. Not only that, Harry and Marv have tracked him down and are both searching diligently for him and attempting to steal what remains in the house. But Kevin's set a few of his trademark traps for them to stumble across.</p><p style=\"\"><u><b>Level 4 - The Chase</b></u></p><p style=\"\">After escaping from the house, Marv and Harry give chase to Kevin through the streets of New York. There are two segments to this level.</p><p style=\"\">Segment 1: The player must run away from Harry and Marv while avoiding the additional baddies along the way. The player must must keep running until reaching the giant Christmas tree.</p><p style=\"\">Segment 2: Once inside the Christmas tree, the player needs to climb to the very top and grab the flashing star in order to receive the help of the pigeon lady. The player needs to call for help for her to throw bird seeds on Marv and Harry three times each to properly defeat them and win the game. The player can bounce on the ends of the Christmas tree branches to get higher up on the screen.</p><h3>Reception</h3><p style=\"\">The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on. A prominent example is made by The Angry Video Game Nerd, stating that when a key falls towards the player, the player's impulse is to collect it, Instead the key inflicts damage to the player.</p>",

For example, jumping on the heads of enemies do not affect them, and players can carry enemies by standing on them and picking them up. Enemies are defeated by either throwing them off the screen, throwing them at other enemies, or by throwing a special <a href=\"/pow-block/3055-421\" data-ref-id=\"3055-421\">POW block</a>. Several enemies (such as the mischievous <a href=\"/shy-guy/3015-3891\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3891\">Shy Guys</a> and the unusual <a href=\"/birdo/3005-957\" data-ref-id=\"3005-957\">Birdo</a>) and concepts (such as Luigi's tall, thin appearance and the exploding <a href=\"/bob-omb/3055-480\" data-ref-id=\"3055-480\">Bob-ombs</a>) have carried over to other games in the <a href=\"/mario/3025-1\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\">Mario</a> franchise.</p><p style=\"\">A 16-bit remake was created for the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in 1993 as part of <a href=\"/super-mario-all-stars/3030-18529\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18529\">Super Mario All-Stars</a>. This remake adds some enhancements, such as allowing players to switch characters after losing a life and increasing the amount of lives given. This version was further re-made for the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> on June 11, 2001 as <a href=\"/super-mario-advance/3030-5215\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5215\">Super Mario Advance</a>, adding a variety of new features (including the \"Yoshi Challenge\", in which players re-visit stages to find hidden <a href=\"/yoshi-egg/3055-588\" data-ref-id=\"3055-588\">Yoshi eggs</a>, and a new point-scoring system). The original re-make was also released in weekly parts (as <em>BS Super Mario USA: Power Challenge</em>) for the Japan-exclusive Stellaview satellite modem add-on from March 1996 to April 1996. The original game was released for the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> (via <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii Virtual Console</a>) on July 2, 2007.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-494179\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494179-super_mario_bros._2_11.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494179-super_mario_bros._2_11.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494179\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/494179-super_mario_bros._2_11.png\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Super Mario Bros. 2 is a standard side-scrolling platformer where players must traverse through 20 stages (split into seven unique areas, called Worlds), defeating various enemies and navigating dangerous obstacles in order to find mystical orbs (which trigger special doorways, called Hawkmouths, that lead to the next stage). Before a new stage is played (or after a continue from losing all lives), players can switch between four characters (each with their own unique abilities and attributes):</p><ul><li><a href=\"/mario/3005-177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"><strong>Mario</strong></a> - The titular hero and red-suited plumber, Mario is the most balanced character of the four.</li><li><a href=\"/luigi/3005-370\" data-ref-id=\"3005-370\"><strong>Luigi</strong></a> - Mario's brother and a green-suited plumber, Luigi is not as fast as Mario (and does not pick up items as fast), but he has the highest jumping power in the game.</li><li><a href=\"/toad/3005-845\" data-ref-id=\"3005-845\"><strong>Toad</strong></a> - The princess's attendant, Toad has the weakest jumping ability in the game, but is the fastest character (in both movement and picking up items).</li><li><a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"><strong>Princess</strong></a> - The princess of the Mushroom Kingdom is the slowest character in the game (in terms of both movement and picking up items) and does not jump as high as Mario, but she has the ability to temporarily float in the air (by holding down the jump button while in the air).</li></ul><p style=\"\">Players use the \"A\" button to jump and the \"B\" button to run, pick up objects/enemies, and throw held objects/enemies. Holding down the Jump button, rather than tapping it, causes the character to jump higher. Holding the down direction on the d-pad causes the character to charge up a \"<a href=\"/super-jump/3015-694\" data-ref-id=\"3015-694\">super jump</a>\", in which the next jump will be even higher than usual.</p><p style=\"\">Unlike traditional Mario games, where the hero defeats enemies by jumping on them, Super Mario Bros. 2 requires players to dispose enemies by either throwing them off the screen, throwing them at other enemies, or by throwing other objects (such as vegetables) at them.</p><h2>Sub-Space and Warping</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-494169\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-494169\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/494169-super_mario_bros._2_1.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Luigi entering Sub-Space in Level 1-1, finding a secret Mushroom item.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In each level, the player can find a special flask (the Magic Potion) which, when thrown, summons a door to a unique parallel area called Sub-Space.

      "deck": "A top-down action game originally released for the NES which put players in the shoes of John McClane, the action hero played by Bruce Willis from the popular film Die Hard.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Die Hard follows the plot of the film Die Hard very closely. As <a href=\"/john-mcclane/3005-2143\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2143\"> John McClane</a>, players can explore several levels of <a href=\"/nakatomi-plaza/3035-1039\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1039\"> Nakatomi Plaza</a>. Each level has its own theme, similar to the later <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\"> PlayStation</a> game <a href=\"/die-hard-trilogy/3030-19345\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19345\"> Die Hard Trilogy</a> - there is an office level, a level where meetings take place (with many tables, like one scene in the film), a rooftop, and even the vault from the film makes it into the game. The game presents the player with an almost <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\"> open world</a> experience. For instance, the ultimate goal is to disable the vault so that the Nakatomi Corporation cannot be robbed. Every four minutes, in real time, one of the six locks of the vault is open; theoretically the player only has 24 minutes to finish the game. However, the player can go to the roof and call for help (which is entirely optional), or choose simply to attempt to destroy as many terrorists as possible. Different cinematic sequences are triggered depending on what the player does. In that sense, the game's story is malleable, and does not strictly follow the events of the film.</p><p style=\"\">The game starts the player off with McClane's signature <a href=\"/m9-pistol/3055-940\" data-ref-id=\"3055-940\"> Beretta M92F</a>. After killing terrorists, the player can pick up sub-machine guns, <a href=\"/frag-grenade/3055-3074\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3074\"> grenades</a> and explosives. Health is recovered by drinking cans of <a href=\"/aluminum-can/3055-591\" data-ref-id=\"3055-591\"> soda</a> or snacks, which can be collected as <a href=\"/random-loot/3015-365\" data-ref-id=\"3015-365\"> loot</a> from terrorists or from vending machines throughout the buildings. C4 and detonators can also be collected and can be used should the player desire to destroy the vault. Once McClane's health runs out completely, the game ends. Movement is eight-way from the top down viewpoint; that is the player can move at right or forty-five degree angles. Bullets are also fired in these directions.</p><p style=\"\">There are several interesting mechanics in Die Hard. One mechanic is the foot meter, which measures how worn McClane's feet are. (In the film and in the game, McClane takes off his shoes before the terrorists attack and never has the chance to put footwear on.) Walking over glass or rough surfaces will wear the foot meter away significantly. Once the foot meter reaches the lower levels, McClane's movement speed is significantly impaired. The foot meter can be restored by collecting <a href=\"/first-aid-kit/3055-1285\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1285\"> medical packs</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6518/367491-diehard0001.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367491\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6518/367491-diehard0001.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367491\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6518/367491-diehard0001.png\"></a><figcaption> The player cannot see what lies in wait in the blacked out areas.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Another mechanic is McClane's line of sight. The player cannot see around walls or through doors or in rooms that McClane is not in. Areas not in the player's field of vision are blacked out. As all action in the game is unscripted, including the appearance of terrorists and their locations in the level, terrorists may often be hiding in dark areas waiting for the player to walk into their line of sight. McClane can use stairs, elevators and ventilation shafts to travel around the building. All the glass windows across the levels are fully breakable, and can be traveled through. As such, the entire world of the game is remarkably fully realized.</p><p style=\"\">As the player progresses further into the game, the terrorists grow savvy to the player's movements. After killing many terrorists, for example, Hans Gruber will order radio silence, making it impossible for the player to be notified of the terrorists' movements.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Bandai produced this Saint Seiya RPG to cash in on a recent movie adaptation of the TV anime and manga. The manga concerns five brave souls, called \"Saints\", who fight for the Greek goddess Athena against the other gods of the Greek pantheon. In order to do so, they each wear sacred armor that contain signs of the zodiac. The show was popular in its native Japan and in a few other countries such as France, but would not see an English translation for some time.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">To tie-in with the astrological theme, the game will ask for the player's date of birth. Depending on which sign they have, they will be assigned a different initial stat layout. It's a concept that would later be seen in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19864\" href=\"/final-fantasy-tactics/3030-19864\">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Regular gameplay plays out like a brawler: Seiya walks along and fights enemies with his punch attacks; defeating the enemy grants Seiya some amount of experience points. When faced with an important story character or boss, the game switches to a turn-based RPG mode where the player must strategically plan out their course of attack, as well as maintain their defenses. Seiyu and his opponent take turns trading blows until one of them falls.</p><p style=\"\">Experience points, unlike in most JRPGs, must be spent in various attributes to have any effect, with larger stats needing more experience points to increase further. This is opposed to the usual system of simply hitting a pre-determined total to level up, increasing all the character's stats instantaneously.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Silent Service is an NES game in which the player controls a submarine and patrols and engages in skirmishes with other submarines. Its is more like a submarine sim then a traditional arcade game.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=\"\">Silent Service is set in the Pacific Ocean during World War Two. The player assumes control of a U.S. Submarine, the U.S.S. Raven, which is assigned missions to carry out. This side of the war is rarely told in games. There are two types of game modes to play; Convoy Actions and War Patrol. Convoy Actions are specific scenarios in which the player is given a specific objective to complete. In War Patrol mode players are given the ability to roam anywhere in the Pacific  for 30 days looking for Japanese ships to attack. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">This game is basically a submarine simulation game. It uses realistic tactics such as the End Around, as well as having the ability to adjust visibility and dud torpedoes. The game also gives you control of the rudders, periscope, and ballast, as well as displaying the speed, depth, and heading of your sub. You are placed in the waters of Japan and you are required to ping ships with your sonar in order to detect enemies. This game has a relatively steep learning curve to it.</p>",

It's said by developer <a href=\"/toru-iwatani/3040-93065\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93065\">Toru Iwatani</a> to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting <a href=\"/dot/3055-1161\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1161\">pellets</a> (or \"dots\") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (<a href=\"/blinky/3005-138\" data-ref-id=\"3005-138\">Blinky</a>, <a href=\"/pinky/3005-144\" data-ref-id=\"3005-144\">Pinky</a>, <a href=\"/inky/3005-245\" data-ref-id=\"3005-245\">Inky</a>, and <a href=\"/clyde/3005-320\" data-ref-id=\"3005-320\">Clyde</a>, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a <a href=\"/power-pellet/3055-685\" data-ref-id=\"3055-685\">power pellet</a>, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players can also get bonus <a href=\"/fruit/3055-382\" data-ref-id=\"3055-382\">fruit</a> pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a <a href=\"/kill-screen/3015-1191\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1191\">kill screen</a>. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a \"perfect play\" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named <a title=\"Tōru Iwatani\" href=\"/toru-iwatani/3040-93065\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93065\">Tōru Iwatani</a> over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese</a> title was <i>Pakkuman</i> (パックマン), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase <i>paku-paku taberu</i> (パクパク食べる), where <i>paku-paku</i> describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, <i>kuchi</i> (口). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from <a title=\"Popeye\" href=\"/popeye/3025-571\" data-ref-id=\"3025-571\">Popeye</a>. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's <a title=\"Hockey puck\" href=\"/hockey-puck/3055-400\" data-ref-id=\"3055-400\">hockey puck</a> shape.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> by <a title=\"Bally Technologies\" href=\"/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\">Bally</a> division <a title=\"Midway Games\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway</a>, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.</p><h2>Impact and Legacy</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game – and subsequent <a title=\"Pac-Man (series)\" href=\"/maze/3015-528\" data-ref-id=\"3015-528\">Pac-Man derivatives</a> – became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, <a title=\"Pac-Man (TV series)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">an animated television series</a> and a <a title=\"Pac-Man Fever (song)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_Fever_(song)\" rel=\"nofollow\">top-ten hit single</a>.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were <a href=\"/space/3035-50\" data-ref-id=\"3035-50\">space </a>shooters, <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a> being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of <a title=\"Pong\" href=\"/pong/3025-1724\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1724\">Pong</a>. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing arcade games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">highest-grossing video games</a> of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When first launched in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> by <a href=\"/namco/3010-7420\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco</a> in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3025-343\" data-ref-id=\"3025-343\">Space Invaders</a> and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man '​s success in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic <a title=\"Defender (video game)\" href=\"/defender/3030-5536\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5536\">Defender</a>), while they looked to a racing car game called <a title=\"Rally-X\" href=\"/rally-x/3030-2238\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2238\">Rally-X</a> as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped <a title=\"Asteroids (computer game)\" href=\"/asteroids/3030-1034\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1034\">Asteroids</a> as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing films\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\" rel=\"nofollow\">highest-grossing film</a><a title=\"Star Wars\" href=\"/star-wars/3025-551\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a>.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by <a title=\"Twin Galaxies\" href=\"/twin-galaxies/3010-7078\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7078\">Twin Galaxies</a> at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing arcade games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">highest-grossing video game</a> of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall <a title=\"Game of the Year\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_the_Year\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Best Commercial Arcade Game</a> award at the 1981 <a title=\"Electronic Games\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Games\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade Awards</a>. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a <a title=\"Dixons Retail\" href=\"/dixons/3010-5702\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5702\">Dixons</a> poll in the <a href=\"/united-kingdom/3035-492\" data-ref-id=\"3035-492\">UK</a>.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming <a title=\"Mascot\" href=\"/mascot/3015-1570\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1570\">mascot</a>, the game established the <a title=\"List of maze chase games\" href=\"/maze/3015-528\" data-ref-id=\"3015-528\">maze chase game</a> genre, it demonstrated the potential of <a title=\"Player character\" href=\"/player-character/3015-968\" data-ref-id=\"3015-968\">characters in video games</a>, it opened gaming to <a title=\"Women and video games\" href=\"/games-for-girls/3015-2469\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2469\">female audiences</a>, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature <a title=\"Power-up\" href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-ups</a>, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature <a title=\"Cut scene\" href=\"/cutscene/3015-22\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cut scenes</a>, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though <a title=\"Space Invaders Part II\" href=\"/deluxe-space-invaders/3030-41053\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41053\">Space Invaders Part II</a> employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the <a title=\"Stealth game\" href=\"/stealth/3015-24\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth game</a> genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game <a title=\"Metal Gear\" href=\"/metal-gear/3030-6712\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6712\">Metal Gear</a>, where guards chase <a title=\"Solid Snake\" href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake</a> in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> <a title=\"Open world\" href=\"/sandbox/3015-453\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> game <a title=\"Grand Theft Auto (series)\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3030-13567\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13567\">Grand Theft Auto</a> (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> shooters such as <a title=\"MIDI Maze\" href=\"/midi-maze/3030-16825\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16825\">MIDI Maze</a> (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer <a title=\"John Romero\" href=\"/john-romero/3040-2\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2\">John Romero</a> credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; <a title=\"Wolfenstein 3D\" href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">Wolfenstein 3D</a> was similar in <a title=\"Level design\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">level design</a> and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while <a title=\"Doom (video game)\" href=\"/doom/3030-7326\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"> </p><h3> </h3>",

      "deck": "Vindicators is a 1-2 player top-down, run-and-gun, shoot-em-up action game, released in 1988. It was published by Tengen for home platforms; an arcade version of Vindicators was published by Atari.",
      "description": "<h2>Story</h2> Vindicators takes place in the year 2525, outside Galaxy TR-15. The mission is to intercept and destroy the invading forces from the evil Tangent Empire by proceeding through multi-level stations, and securing each station by demolishing its control centre, using the SR-88 Strategic Battle Tank.<br /><br /> As \"team commanders\" of these SR-88 Strategic Battle Tanks, players must traverse the Tangent Empire's 14 space stations equipped with turrets and highly mobile armored tanks that constantly patrol the Tangent's fortifications.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2> Players control a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-92\" href=\"/tank/3055-92\">           tank</a>, navigating through multiple levels and shooting enemies (enemy tanks, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-43\" href=\"/turret/3055-43\">          turrets</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-611\" href=\"/ufo/3055-611\">         flying saucers</a>) and obstacles while their tank's fuel levels gradually decrease. The tanks have <a data-ref-id=\"3055-644\" href=\"/energy-force-shield/3055-644\">        shields</a>, which deplete when hit by enemy shots. As fuel decreases, the tank's speed slows. Once all fuel is lost, the tank explodes and players are charged a life. Throughout the levels, players can collect additional fuel, stars (the game's currency), shields, and power-ups such as homing missiles and bombs.<br /><br /> Players navigate their tanks towards the end of the level, as the screen scrolls bottom-up, much like a traditional shooter's level design. Each level contains a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-105\" href=\"/key/3055-105\">       key</a> that is required to open a door at the end of a level.<br /><br /> Some levels contain <a data-ref-id=\"3015-50\" href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50\">      boss fights</a>. These bosses are practically impervious to a tank's regular fire -- <a data-ref-id=\"3015-700\" href=\"/power-up/3015-700\">     power-ups</a> are essential to defeating the game's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-229\" href=\"/bosses/3015-229\">    bosses</a>.<br /><br /> Before a new level begins, players are able to use their \"stars\" to purchase power-ups, shields and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-133\" href=\"/upgradeable-weapons/3015-133\">   upgrades</a>, including increased speed and more powerful default weaponry.<br /><br /> The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-84\" href=\"/arcade/3045-84\">  arcade</a> version of Vindicators was housed in a tank-shaped cabinet which also had a unique double-joystick, one for each hand. Both joysticks had thumb buttons on top, and moved only up and down. Holding both joysticks in the same direction would move the tank up and down the screen, while moving the joysticks in opposite directions allow the tank to turn. The 1P/2P buttons allowed players to cycle through their weapons. The arcade version was also more challenging, with more powerful enemies, weaker tanks, and a greater rate of fuel depletion. The home platform version, on the other hand, had difficulty settings.<br /><br /><h2>T-shirt Contest</h2> <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari/3010-182\">             Atari</a>'s original arcade version of Vindicators included a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-2884\" href=\"/shirt/3055-2884\"> t-shirt</a> contest. The game contained three \"contest\" bonus levels, which contained a \"contest star\" to be collected upon completion. If a player collected all three contest stars and nine stars from the game's regular levels, they could compete in a special time-limited contest level. Completing this level would earn the player an official <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari/3010-182\">             Atari</a>/Vindicators t-shirt, provided the establishment that owned the game cabinet had said t-shirts on site.<br /><br /><h2>Tengen's NES Version</h2>Like many games published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-752\" href=\"/tengen/3010-752\">             Tengen</a>, Vindicators for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21\">             Nintendo Entertainment System</a> was unlicensed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90\">             Nintendo</a>. As such, the cartridge was <a data-ref-id=\"3010-752\" href=\"/tengen/3010-752\">             Tengen</a>'s proprietary black cartridge, containing a special chip designed to work despite the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21\">             NES</a>'s lockout system which prevented unlicensed games from operating properly.",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Legendary Wings was originally known as Ares no Tsubasa (\"<a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/ares/3005-1098\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1098\">Ares</a>'s Wings\") when it came out in the Japanese Arcades in 1986. Two years later a NES version was released exclusively for North America, the first Capcom game to receive this treatment. Much of the team that worked on Legendary Wings were also the developers behind the <a href=\"/mega-man/3030-5251\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5251\">Mega Man</a> games, and it is rumored that they were tasked with creating the NES version of Legendary Wings in order to be allowed to work on Mega Man's <a href=\"/mega-man-2/3030-14026\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14026\">sequel</a>.</p><p style=\"\">An interesting quirk of Legendary Wings is how it'll occasionally switch to a side-scrolling mode whenever the hero enters a giant statue's mouth (known as a \"trap zone\") or reaches the end of the stage. The goal of these areas is the same: Simply pass through and survive the waves of enemies. Infrequently the player can also find \"Lucky!\" zones full of power-ups and bonus point objects by destroying a specific ground enemy and entering the hole they leave behind.</p><h3>Differences Between Arcade and NES Versions</h3><ul><li>The side-scrolling levels in the Arcade were on foot and played more like a run-and-gun platformer than a shoot-'em-up.</li><li>The Arcade allows for two players: A woman in a pink bikini named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/michelle-heart/3005-5790\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5790\">Michelle Heart</a> and a man in blue briefs named <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/kevin-walker/3005-27062\" data-ref-id=\"3005-27062\">Kevin Walker</a>. The NES game just has the latter character, with no second player option. A version of the Arcade game also changed Michelle to a second male character.</li><li>The power-up system is slightly different. In the Arcade mode, the player loses a life when hit and loses all their power-ups. In the NES version, they simply revert to the last power-up level they had achieved. In the case of the Phoenix power-up, the player can take up to three hits before reverting.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Like all the core Dizzy games, the character is able to move and jump through a world full of dangers and puzzles to solve. The underlying concept of Fantasy World Dizzy is that all of Dizzy's friends (the Yolkfolk) have been magically ensorcelled with various fairy-tale curses and Dizzy must rescue them all.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">The game is non-linear, allowing the player to travel in any direction they wish. However, certain obstacles will restrict movement around the map until they are dealt with. This can be done by collecting items (Dizzy has inventory space for three) and applying them where necessary to solve puzzles and facilitate progress. Eventually, Dizzy must find all his friends, use items to rescue them from their various enchanted plights and then finally locate his girlfriend Daisy. For the best ending, Dizzy must also have collected 30 gold coins scattered throughout the game, usually in hard to reach or well-hidden places.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style=\"\">Internet critic Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw often calls the game one of his favorites.</p>",

      "deck": "A fast-paced American Football game with all 28 teams from the National Football League circa 1991.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Tecmo Super Bowl is the followup to the successful <a href=\"/tecmo-bowl/3030-11229\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11229\">Tecmo Bowl</a>. The format roughly follows a standard game of American football, where each team has 11 players and attempts to move the ball into the opponent's end zone by using a combination of running and throwing the ball. Between possessions, the teams switch sides and the player takes on the opposite role of attempting to keep the opponent from scoring in their end zone.</p><p style=\"\">Tecmo Super Bowl would be remade for the SNES and Genesis platforms two years later in 1993. This version was also named <a href=\"/tecmo-super-bowl/3030-31196\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31196\">Tecmo Super Bowl</a>, and should not be mistaken for this one.</p><h2>Improvements</h2><p style=\"\">Tecmo Super Bowl does not depart much from Tecmo Bowl's formula, but rather focuses on perfecting the system already laid down.</p><p style=\"\">Additional play mechanics include Most significantly, playbooks are expanded from four plays to eight, allowing each team to double their selection of plays before each snap. Additionally, before the game, players can customize their team's playbook to better fit their play style and team's strengths. If the defense picks the same play as the offense, they will likely cause the offensive team to lose yardage or turn over the ball, but with more plays to choose from, the likelihood of the defense picking the right play is significantly reduced. Additional new mechanics include the ability to substitute players, varying conditions of players, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble\" rel=\"nofollow\">fumbles</a>, and player injuries.</p><p style=\"\">Place kicking is modified significantly by adding the option to perform an \"onside kick.\" By putting very little force behind the kickoff, the kicking team can attempt to steal the ball away from the receiving team, with the risk that the receiving team will have excellent field position if they manage to hold onto the ball. Additionally, players do not control how hard the kicker kicks during extra point attempts and field goals. Rather, an arrow moves back and forth to determine if the kick will be on target, as opposed to wide right or left.</p><p style=\"\">While Tecmo Bowl had all of the players from the <a href=\"/national-football-league/3015-1589\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1589\">National Football League</a>, they did not have the license to use the NFL team names. With Tecmo Super Bowl, they've added the NFL team license, allowing them to use team names and colors, and the actual NFL schedule from the year appropriate to when the game came out. Some players though, like Jim Kelly, only appear as \"QB Bills.\" Additionally, after the regular season, players that make the playoffs will then play playoff games, including conference championship games, in an attempt to get to and win the Super Bowl and take home the title of NFL Champion. One of the biggest improvements to scheduling is that players can take control of multiple teams, skip any game that they're not interested in, or let the computer play out the season for them. This feature has been copied in many football games that have come out since Tecmo Super Bowl.</p><p style=\"\">A Pro Bowl option was also added to Tecmo Super Bowl. This option is a feature which allows users/players to fill out All-Star rosters with whichever players they choose for both the AFC (American Football Conference) and the NFC (National Football Conference) and have them play the actual All-Star game; the Pro Bowl.</p><h2>Cult following and legacy</h2><ul><li>In Tecmo Super Bowl tournaments, it is common to make the Buffalo Bills and L.A. Raiders off limits since both Thurman Thomas and Bo Jackson are so overpowered, they can essentially break the game because they are so fast.</li><li>Tecmo Bowl tournaments still exist today, with people hacking the game and modifying teams to fit modern expansion teams with full rosters and updated logos. The most prolific tournament takes place in Madison, WI and will feature 72 players in 2010 to accommodate for its increased popularity.</li><li>Tecmo Super Bowl has been adorned on many \"Best Video Games of All Time\" lists. These lists include a Top 100 ranking from both Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN.</li></ul>",

The game was subsequently let loose on the American market two years later, and in Europe a year after that. Faxanadu is a spin-off from the 1985 <a href=\"/nihon-falcom-corp/3010-849\" data-ref-id=\"3010-849\">Falcom</a> game \"<a href=\"/xanadu-dragon-slayer-ii/3030-15342\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15342\">Xanadu</a>,\" and the name \"Faxanadu\" is a portmanteau word derived from the amalgamation of the words \"Famicom\" and \"Xanadu.\"</p><p style=\"\">Xanadu was actually the second in Falcom's <a href=\"/dragon-slayer/3025-783\" data-ref-id=\"3025-783\">Dragon Slayer</a> series, originally made for Japanese home computer <a href=\"/msx/3045-15\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX</a> though most of them would find their way onto the Famicom. Curiously, Faxanadu - the second Dragon Slayer game - came out right on the Famicom on the heels of Compile's port of <a href=\"/romancia-dragon-slayer-jr/3030-17708\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17708\">Romancia</a>, the third Dragon Slayer game, which in turn was released a few months after <a href=\"/legacy-of-the-wizard/3030-4068\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4068\">Legacy of the Wizard</a>, the fourth Dragon Slayer game.

The walls are crumbling and the wells have run dry, and the people are being savaged by a mysterious influx of monsters. Several of the non player-characters in the opening segments of the game, as if sensing the PC's unique brand of heroism, charge him with the task of restoring the land to its rightful state. Eolis's King tells him that the town's life source, the Elf Fountain water, is no longer flowing and that many men have perished in their efforts to discover what went wrong. As the town's last hope (the guy outside perpetually smoking a pipe must be a conscientious objector), the King sends the player character on their way with 1500 Golds (a famous and recurring translation error in the game), and leaves the player to get on with it. The player learns that the Dwarves at the top of the World Tree have discovered a meteorite and have been manipulated by it, turning insane and damaging the World Tree and it's water system, while attacking the elves, the other inhabitants of the World Tree. It is up to the player to defeat the evil influence and restore the World Tree, restoring peace between the dwarves, elves and the humans.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/243794-800x600_game.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243794\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3438/243794-800x600_game.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243794\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3438/243794-800x600_game.gif\"></a><figcaption>The World Tree.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game's starting town of Eolis is situated at the base of an exceptionally large tree known as the World Tree, which constitutes the game's various areas. The player steadily moves upwards through the World Tree in a mostly linear fashion, although it is possible and indeed necessary in some cases to backtrack, in order to open new doors or to buy items, weapons and armor. The player will encounter a wide variety of enemies on his travels, from large skulls that hop on one leg to shuffling crab-like creatures with large spines for protection. Enemies can be defeated in a variety of ways, ranging from physical attacks such as daggers and swords, to projectile magic spells. As the game progresses and the player gains access to more towns, the player's weapons, magic and armor can be upgraded using the gold that the enemies occasionally drop once eliminated. Other enemies will drop food, which will restore a small amount of health points instead.</p><p style=\"\">The player also earns experience points as enemies are defeated, which increases the player's Experience Rank, earning them new titles. In this sense, Faxanadu incorporates some RPG elements to its gameplay alongside the more action-oriented fighting mechanics.</p><p style=\"\">The game could not be saved as such, although the player could receive a password in the form of a Mantra that the Gurus in the game's many towns would reveal upon visiting them, allowing the player to continue from the place in which the Mantra was received.</p><h3>Towns</h3><p style=\"\">Faxanadu has many towns that the player can visit. In order of discovery, they are Eilos, Apolune, Forepaw, Mascon, Victim, Conflate, Daybreak and Dartmoor.</p><p style=\"\">Each town holds host to a general list of establishments, but some towns will be absent of particular locations. For example, the first town in the game, Eolis, contains establishments not found later in the game, such as a gym which restores health. Some locations are not exclusive to towns, either. Hardware stores, churches and homes can be found in dungeons.</p><ul><li><b>Church:</b> Players can consult the gurus to save their game, recieve valuable information or items such as rings.</li><li><b>Butcher:</b> Players can buy fresh food, which will restore a small amount of mana and health.</li><li><b>Hardware Store:</b> Players can purchase items such as weapons, potions or elixers.</li><li><b>Inn:</b> Players can speak to patrons to learn information.</li><li><b>Hospital:</b> Players can pay a fee to have all their health and mana restored.</li><li><b>Locksmith:</b> Players can buy keys here.</li><li><b>Home:</b> Another location where players can gain information.</li></ul><h3>Loot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1685601-items.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1685601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2579/1685601-items.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1685601\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1685601-items.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2579/1685601-items.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Players can switch out different items in any location.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Loot such as armor, weapons, magic spells or items can be found out in the wild, or purchased from stores.

      "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257484\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5800/257484-bionic_c.009.png\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5800/257484-bionic_c.009.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257484\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5800/257484-bionic_c.009.png\"></a><figcaption>Rad Spencer</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The story begins with <a href=\"/nathan-rad-spencer/3005-124\" data-ref-id=\"3005-124\">Rad Spencer</a>, the titular Bionic Commando, being tasked with rescuing <a href=\"/commando/3030-6850\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6850\">Commando</a>'s protagonist, <a href=\"/super-joe/3005-52\" data-ref-id=\"3005-52\">Super Joe</a> from the \"Badds,\" an evil empire bent on world domination, lead by the terrorist fiend, <a href=\"/adolf-hitler/3005-38\" data-ref-id=\"3005-38\">Master D</a>. Super Joe had been sent in to stop the Badds' top secret superweapon, dubbed \"The Albatross.\" All contact with Super Joe was lost, and Rad was sent in to go get him back.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Capcom took a page from Mega Man by giving the player the ability to choose which levels to tackle in any order. Players are initially presented with an overhead map of the game, divided into 16 levels. Players make their way from point-to-point, choosing whether to dive into the level and fight off the Badds and collecting power-ups, or moving onto the next level in the quest to rescue Super Joe. Of course, some power-ups are required to progress through certain levels, while others simply make it easier to take out more of the Badds. For example, in one level, the player must have the rocket launcher to destroy a wall to proceed.</p><p style=\"\">The weapons have a cost/benefit system. One gun has a wider shot, sacrificing range. The rocket launcher can cross the entire screen, regardless of obstacles, but has a slow rate of fire. The types of enemies in each level varies, so matching weapons to enemies is crucial to success. This system is in contrast to simply getting more powerful weapons progressively throughout the game. Any weapon is viable in the correct situation.</p><p style=\"\">One type of collectible upgrade is the communicator. In many cases the player must communicate with FSA agents to proceed through the level, in order to do this, the player must have equipped the correct colored communicator for that level. Failure to do so could result in the inability to complete the level. In special communication rooms, the player has the option to communicate with FSA agents or wiretap BADD communication- provided they have brought the correct communicator. In some cases, communication with the FSA agent results in the opening of a mission critical door, hence without the communicator, the level could not be completed. In instances where the player is unable to complete the level, the player can choose to be extracted from the level without penalty to lives, continues or upgrades, but losing any progress in that level.</p><p style=\"\">Once in the level, the game has a very similar look and feel to other Capcom platformers, like Mega Man, <a href=\"/ducktales/3030-15799\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15799\">DuckTales</a>, and <a href=\"/ghosts-n-goblins/3030-17031\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17031\">Ghosts 'N Goblins</a>. Like those games, Rad will have to climb up towers, cross spiked pits, and shoot his way through wave after wave of enemy en route to the stage's boss. However, he cannot jump; instead, Rad is armed with a bionic arm, which can cling to practically any surface, allowing him to swing his way across the level's hazards. While difficult to truly master, using the momentum from swinging quickly becomes second nature, though it's still pretty common to miss a crucial jump and fall to Rad's death. Being an old-school NES game, Bionic Commando doesn't forgive mistakes.</p><p style=\"\">On the level select screen, enemy trucks patrol the roads. If Spencer's helicopter comes into contact with one of these, Spencer must navigate an isometric top-down perspective battle sequence. During these sequences, the Bionic Arm no longer provides the game's jumping mechanic, but springs in an AOE attack radius around Spencer, knocking back enemies and deflecting projectiles. Possibly to combat the difficulty of the game, continues can be collected by destroying trucks in these sequences.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style=\"\">In 2000, Bionic Commando received a sequel in the form of the <a href=\"/game-boy-color/3045-57\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Colour</a> game <a href=\"/bionic-commando-elite-forces/3030-12043\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12043\">Bionic Commando: Elite Forces</a>. However, the story of Elite Forces was entirely unrelated to the story of the original game, and just shared the concept of a side-scrolling war game starring a soldier with a grappling-hook arm. Much later, in 2009, it was followed by another sequel, this time continuing the story of the original game, simply called <a href=\"/bionic-commando/3030-20470\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20470\">Bionic Commando</a>. To help promote the new game, developer <a href=\"/grin/3010-405\" data-ref-id=\"3010-405\">GRIN</a>  also released a remake of the original game, entitled <a href=\"/bionic-commando-rearmed/3030-20483\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20483\">Bionic Commando: ReArmed</a>. Unfortunately, the general reception to the new Bionic Commando was mixed, although the ReArmed side project was rather well-received due to its nostalgia value. While no further \"real\" sequels in the franchise have come out since, a follow-up to ReArmed, <a href=\"/bionic-commando-rearmed-2/3030-30945\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30945\">Bionic Commando: ReArmed 2</a>, was released in 2011.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Starship Hector is a deliberately old-fashioned shooter (even for its time) designed for core shooter fans and geared towards gathering high scores. To this end, it has a couple of alternate timed challenges to the main campaign mode with which players can practice getting as high a score as possible.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The vertically-scrolling stages are very familiar to <a href=\"/xevious/3030-1487\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1487\">Xevious</a> fans, as the ship is able to shoot airborne targets with their guns and ground-based targets with their bombs, and never vice versa. Unlike Xevious, bombs continue flying vertically upwards like gun bullets, instead of stopping short at a pre-defined point (i.e. when they hit the ground). Like Xevious, there are also special hidden areas the bombs might hit which create a smart bomb like effect, removing all other ground-based targets in the vicinity. Chances there that there's one nearby if there's a particularly heavy presence of ground-based enemies. Additionally, the player can constantly bomb the odd rock devil heads on the ground for small health boosts, as the player's ship has a health bar rather than the customary single hit point.</p><p style=\"\">The horizontally-scrolling stages are far more like Gradius or R-Type. Players can still bomb targets on the ground, but must be aware of the arc that bombs take to fall downwards. Once the bombs touch down, they continue rolling across the ground until they hit something much as they do in the vertically-scrolling stages.</p><p style=\"\">In both modes, there are no power-ups for either of the player's ship's weapons. Occasionally, this will mean that avoiding enemies is safer than trying to destroy them, as many require multiple shots. At the end of each stage is a boss, which usually can only be destroyed by systematically blowing up each gun turret and segment that comprises it.</p>",

The NES and Game Boy versions were created first in late 1992, followed by the SNES and Genesis versions in mid-1993. The characters in the SNES version actually break the fourth wall to remark on the earlier versions and the similar material, displaying the same wry self-referential humor of the series it's based on.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When the Genesis version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review score of 4 out of 10 writing, \"...This is an almost carbon-copy of the NES version, with the poor control intact! Dig the way Rocky attacks with those huge antlers and climbs the side of that mountain! The variety of games is nice, but the whole thing looks rushed\".</p>",

It allows Mega Man to store up a powerful burst that can inflict three units of damage to enemies and even Robot Masters. In fact, it becomes the preferred weapon to use against a few of them. Certain enemies also have a gimmick requiring the use of the Mega Buster to defeat them.</p><p style=\"\">Mega Man also keeps all of his previous abilities from Mega Man 3, including the slide and his canine compatriot <a href=\"/rush/3005-1318\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1318\">Rush</a>. Additionally, Mega Man can also find two special items called the Wire and <a href=\"/balloon/3055-720\" data-ref-id=\"3055-720\">Balloon </a>hidden in certain stages. The Wire acts like a grappling hook that can launch Mega Man vertically, and the Balloon creates floating platforms nearly identical to Item-1 from Mega Man 2.

The goal is to collect secret documents from the building, while moving from floor to floor using an increasingly complex series of elevators. Enemy agents appear from behind closed doors, and Otto must outwit them via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.</p><h2>Cabinet</h2><p style=\"\">The arcade version's cabinet is a standard upright.

At that point Darkman will either proceed to the next level or face a boss fight, if the player is going up against one of the members of Durant's gang. During the levels where you are attacking one of Durant's crew, Darkman spends part of the level disguised as the boss of the level. Darkman can do the boss' moves, and enemies will not necessarily attack you. However, this disguise only lasts for a limited time, determined by how well the player did on the photography stages. <br/> <br/>The shooting gallery stages put you behind a camera, instead of a gun, as you take pictures of the boss of the next stage to build up a disguise. While Darkman cannot be killed on this stage, your performance determines how long Darkman's disguise lasts on the next level. <br/> <br/>Dangling stages put Darkman hanging at the end of a rope underneath a helicopter as he's sent through traffic, like in the climactic scene with Durant towards the end of the film. Through this, Darkman can move up and down the rope, and collect power-ups and 1-ups in the environment. However, he can also be killed if he hits too many vehicles.",

      "deck": "Bases Loaded allowed players to control one of twelve fictional teams in either single player which allowed up to two players, or a full season. The game featured a television style depiction where the player took the perspective of the pitcher.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Bases Loaded, released by Jaleco in Japan in 1987 and then again in the United States in 1988 was one game in a strong line-up of NES baseball sims. One of the unique aspects of the game was the \"over the pitcher's shoulder\" view, commonly found in televised baseball games. This allowed for a more interesting pitching/hitting interface as pitchers could now throw high and low and batters could hit high/low, inside/outside, as well. Like most sport sims of the time, Bases Loaded dosent feature any MLB licensed teams, stadiums or players. The game features 12 teams with there own strengths and weaknesses:</p><ul><li>Boston</li><li>D.C.</li><li>Jersey</li><li>Hawaii</li><li>N.Y.</li><li>L.A.</li><li>Miami</li><li>Kansas</li><li>Omaha</li><li>Texas</li><li>Philly</li><li>Utah</li></ul><p style=\"\">Some teams were well-balanced at the plate, on the mound, and in the field, while others had particularly strong aspects counterbalanced by weak characteristics. For example, Hawaii features strong hitting and a pretty good pitching staff, while Kansas has exceptional pitching and mediocre hitting.</p><p style=\"\">Jersey was famous for their power hitter, Paste. Batting third, Paste had a stellar .467 batting average and 60 home runs. Based upon these statistics (the only offensive statistics to inform player ability in Bases Loaded were batting average and total home runs), he was easily the most powerful and talented hitter in the game. Paste is also featured in the non-playable demo that loops during the intro screen, where he hits a deep grand slam into the center field bleachers.</p><p style=\"\">Another first for gaming was the ability to charge the mound and fight the pitcher. Only select players could do this and it was an event that was usually triggered after a player was plunked in the at-bat following their last at-bat were they hit a home run. All in all, this feature was implemented well, entertaining to watch and not overused.</p><h2>Batting</h2><p style=\"\">A first for baseball video games in terms of batting was the different batting stances a batter was assigned, previously batters all looked the same and stood in the batter's box the same way. There are a total of three different batting stances in the game.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177761-basesloaded_stance3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177761\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 134px\" data-ratio=\"1.0074626865672\" data-width=\"134\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177761-basesloaded_stance3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177761\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132099/2177761-basesloaded_stance3.png\"></a></figure></td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177763-basesloaded_stance1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177763\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 129px\" data-ratio=\"1.0387596899225\" data-width=\"129\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:103.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177763-basesloaded_stance1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177763\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132099/2177763-basesloaded_stance1.png\"></a></figure></td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177762-basesloaded_stance2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177762\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 124px\" data-ratio=\"1.0403225806452\" data-width=\"124\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/132099/2177762-basesloaded_stance2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177762\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132099/2177762-basesloaded_stance2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/132099/2177762-basesloaded_stance2.png\"></noscript></a></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>",
