The NES and the SNES versions are actually two different games.</p><h2>NES Version</h2><p style=\"\">In this version the player assumes the role of James Bond Jr. In the first level Bond Jr. is tasked with finding 5 missiles in 45 minutes in an underground complex. Each time he reaches a bomb, he must disarm it via a tile mini game where the player must rearrange the tiles to match the picture the game is showing.</p><p style=\"\">In level two, Bond Jr. must unlock 6 safes in an underground enemy base that's full of enemies and invisible doors. Once the safe has been found, the player has nine tries to find the 4 digit code that randomly changes each time they fail. The player must do all this under 25 minutes.</p><p style=\"\">James Bond Jr. has bombs to blow up certain walls and a trusty gun to shoot bad guys with. To switch weapons the player must press the select button. Bond Jr. can also jump.</p><h2>SNES Version</h2><p style=\"\">This version was in color as opposed to its NES version. It was a mix of shooting and platforming. In the first level, the player must pilot a helicopter equipped with missiles and bombs while avoiding enemy missiles and trees. The second level takes place in a Mayan temple. This level is known for being particularly frustrating as it is full of snakes and Bond can only kick or punch up and thus not hit the enemies. Bond Jr. can mesmerize the snakes with a flute or kill them with grenades.</p><p style=\"\">The game alternates vehicle and exploration missions. Level three is another helicopter mission, level four takes place in the sewers where Bond Jr. must avoid radioactive pools, spikes and mini waves. He can pick up gadgets like a gas mask and grenades that freezes water. The level ends with a boss fight against a submarine.</p><p style=\"\">Level 5 has Bond Jr. piloting a spaceship in a level that looks a lot like <a href=\"/super-r-type/3030-8479\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8479\">Super R-Type</a>. In level 6, he arrives at the enemy's space base where he must avoid turrets and other other such obstacles. He must then defeat the final boss and the game ends like this:</p><p style=\"\">\"You'll pay for this James Bond Jr.!\", to which Bond answers, \"No problem, scum lord! Keep the change!\".</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Contra (the <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade</a> version was known as Gryzor in Europe, while the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> version was released as Probotector) is a 1987 video game developed and published by <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a>. The player controls a large, muscular soldier as he battles his way through waves of foes. Most of its popularity is credited to its two player co-op mode, a rarity at the time. While the arcade version was popular, the series really began to take off when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. Since then, the game has been ported to numerous systems and has had many sequels.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game's music was composed by <a href=\"/hidenori-maezawa/3040-48451\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48451\">Hidenori Maezawa</a> and <a href=\"/kyouhei-sada/3040-48452\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48452\">Kyouhei Sada</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331863\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-331863\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/13084/331863-contra_2008_07_27_11_22_21_35.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A rare calm moment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The goal of the game is to traverse several <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling</a> levels. Equipped with a default <a href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608\" data-ref-id=\"3055-608\">machine gun</a>, the player has to repeatedly tap the button to fire, something that is changed in the game <a href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3016\">Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>. Unlike many other games at the time, the player can still fire while jumping. Other weapons can be collected as well by firing upon flying machines that appear in the level. Other weapons included are a machine gun, a laser, a flame thrower and the spread shot. The player can also pick up a <a href=\"/power-up/3015-700\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power up</a> that enables the player to shoot faster.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are two different types of levels. First, there is the traditional side-scrolling level, but the second is a <a href=\"/third-person-perspective/3015-464\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person</a> shooter. In the third-person shooter levels, the player must explore several rooms in which the player must destroy enemies coming into the room, and destroy the cannons within the room. After defeating all of the rooms a boss is faced. A boss's weak point is often identified by a flashing animation. Guns that available in the side-scrolling level are also available in the third-person levels.</p><h3>Guns</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While Konami never gave official names to the various guns &amp; power-ups, the community at large has come up with commonly accepted names for them:</p><ul><li><b>~=M=~ : Machine Gun</b> - The machine gun does more damage than the default rifle, which is indicated by its slightly larger bullets. The rate of fire remains the same as the default rifle.</li><li><b>~=S=~ : Spread</b> <b>Gun</b>- Possibly the most sought after power-up in the game. \"S\" replaces the default rifle with a machine gun that fires five bullets in a wide arc in front of the player. However, the gun comes with a limitation: players can only have ten bullets on the screen at the same time. So if the player presses the fire button if there are already seven bullets on the screen, the gun will only fire three more bullets. A common workaround for this problem is to get very close to the target before spamming the fire button. This tactic dramatically increases the gun's damage done per second.</li><li><b>~=F=~ : Flare Gun</b> - Shoots slow-moving balls of fire. Only four are allowed on screen at the same time.</li><li><b>~=L=~ : Laser Gun</b> - Each laser shot does 8 bullets worth of damage, but only one laser shot is allowed on the screen at a time. Firing again will cancel the existing laser on screen. This limits the gun's effectiveness in dealing with multiple enemies.</li></ul><h3>Power-Ups</h3><ul><li><b>~=R=~ : Rapid Fire</b> - Temporarily increases the rate of fire for whichever gun is equipped.</li><li><b>~=B=~ : Barrier -</b> Temporarily makes the player invulnerable to damage and gives them a deadly touch, where they can destroy any enemy by simply touching them.</li></ul><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players take on the roles of <a href=\"/bill-rizer/3005-2584\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2584\">Bill Rizer</a> and <a href=\"/lance-bean/3005-2586\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2586\">Lance Bean</a> (codenamed Mad Dog and Scorpion) as they protect earth from an alien invasion known only as Red Falcon. The aliens are supposed to have arrived from a mysterious meteor sixty years previous to the events of the game.</p><h2>Secrets/Cheats</h2><h4>Konami Code</h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While the <a href=\"/konami-code/3015-544\" data-ref-id=\"3015-544\">Konami Code</a> debuted in <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\">Gradius</a>, it achieved legendary status with the incredibly difficult Contra. Using the code, players instantly receive 30 lives, making the game much easier. To activate the code, the player must press: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and then press Start (but Start can be pressed before the code is typed, as well).</p><h4>Steal Lives</h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another series staple. If one player dies in the two player cooperative mode and runs out of lives, that player can steal lives from the other player by holding down A and B simultaneously.</p><h4>Shoot while ducking (Base 1 &amp; 2)</h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Normally, players can't shoot while ducking during these levels. But there is a workaround: Hold 'Up' on Controller 2 while ducking using Controller 1. This will result in the bullets being shot at a higher angle, even though the player is prone.</p><h4>Hard Difficulty / New Game</h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After players beat the game and the credits are done rolling, they can start over with their remaining lives and the same weapon they finished the game with. The game is harder as a result of increased enemy count. The enemies themselves are stronger and shoot more often.</p><h4>Secret Ending (Japanese Version only)</h4><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the ending, hold down Start and Select before the credits start rolling and keep holding it until they are done. This results in a secret ending where Red Falcon vows his revenge.</p><h2>Regional Differences</h2><h3>Probotector</h3><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224038\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224038\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/27120/1224038-probotector1.gif\"></a></figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The European release of Contra was renamed and graphically modified. The arcade version had been released under the name Gryzor but with the same graphics. When the home NES version was going to be released in the PAL region they had to change some of the graphics due to German censorship policies. The name was changed to Probotector a mix of the words Robot and protector, the player characters were changed to robots as well as some enemies.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Contra protagonists became robots RD008 and RC011, and almost all enemies received a mechanized makeover. European gamers generally remember fondly the Probotector games, as well as similarly-themed games such as <a href=\"/turrican/3030-15092\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15092\">Turrican</a>.</p><h3>Japanese and NTSC Differences</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, Konami could improve some aspects of their videogames by utilizing chips inside the cartridges themselves (much like the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a>'s Super FX chip), thus overcoming some of the Famicom's limitations.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Contra received a full intro sequence, an extended ending sequence and small <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes</a> in between levels with a short report and a <a href=\"/minimap/3015-185\" data-ref-id=\"3015-185\">minimap</a> depicting where the player is headed next, as well as a large figure of the protagonist firing a gun or listening to a radio. Also, some of the background pieces gained animations, such as the waving trees in the Jungle and Snow Field, and the twitching organic landscape of The Alien's Lair.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Players fly their ship up the screen across various landscapes and shoot at enemies who descend from the top of the screen. Players have guns and bombs at their disposal to destroy enemies. Guns have unlimited ammunition, and are a player's primary form of attack. Bombs are more powerful, and are used up through use. A player begins the game with three lives. If the player makes contact with an enemy or an enemy projectile, they will lose a life and restart without the powerups they had collected to that point.</p><p style=\"\">Much of the strategy in <i>Gun-Nac</i> emerges from collecting powerups, of which there are several. Powerups are released when enemies are destroyed. There are five types of guns in the game and four types of bombs. These are represented visually as circles around numbers (for guns) or letters (for bombs). By collecting identical weapon powerups in sequence, a player can enhance that weapon's capability. For example, in it's basic form, the starting gun (number \"1\") simply fires directly ahead of the player. If the player collects more \"1\" powerups in sequence, however, the gun will start to fire forward, to the sides, and even behind the player. The maximum power of a weapon is reached once five of its powerups have been collected. If a player collects a weapon powerup that is different from the weapon they are currently using, they will immediately switch to the new weapon at it's lowest strength. This means that a player must avoid unwanted powerups in addition to enemies.</p><p style=\"\">Additionally, enemies will sometimes drop a \"wing\" powerup. This adds improves the capabilities of whatever weapon the player is using and allows the player's ship to endure one extra hit before the player loses a life.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130768/1858662-gun_nac_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1858662\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130768/1858662-gun_nac_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1858662\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/130768/1858662-gun_nac_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The store screen.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It is also possible to buy either a \"wing\" powerup or additional powerups to the player's current weapon in between stages at a shop screen.

Using the A button would fire a small projectile upward, standard to most vertical shooters. However, the B button fires a round ball of energy in the direction the ship is heading, allowing the ship to take on foes from any side, even behind. This weapon can be upgraded by destroying certain enemy ships, or certain structures placed on the ground. Each type of upgrade is numbered from 0 to 9. Also, each of the upgrades can be recollected up to 3 times in a row to upgrade the weapon further for more damage dealt or shield provided.</p><p style=\"\">Zanac is also notable for its unique hardware-based cheat code. To access the level select, the player must consecutively reset their NES 13 times.</p>",

It had different names on each platform; Burai Fighter on the NES, Burai Fighter Deluxe on the Game Boy and Burai Fighter Color in Japan and Space Marauder in the US on the Game Boy Color. The game has two different types of game play levels, described below.</div><div><h2>Story</h2><div><div>In Burai Fighter you control a nameless hero whose mission is to defeat the Burai and destroy their seven bases. The Burai are a race of super-brains, who for thousands of years have been trying to take over the universe. They can’t do it alone however so they have been busy creating armies of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-733\" href=\"/mutants/3015-733\" slug=\"mutants\">robo-mutants</a>. They produce these monsters at their manufacturing bases, which of course you must destroy. You have to face the five Burai: Giganticrab, Jawsipede, Fangskull, Torchwing and finally Slimdragon. You’ll have an arsenal of weapons and your proton pack to aid you but even then, it’ll be a challenge.</div><div><h2>Game Play</h2><div><div>Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling  shooter that is unique from many other shooters for a variety of reasons.</div><br/><div>Burai Fighter is unlike most shooters as the game doesn’t just scroll from one side to the other, it often changes directions and takes different paths. Not all of the game’s levels are side scrolling though. A few of the levels of played from the top down perspective with the objective being you trying to find a base and destroy it. Before the beginning of these levels you are giving a map showing where you are and where the base is; yes, like a mall map.</div><br/><div>The game is unique from most other shooters in the fact that you can freely touch any wall without being damaged. In fact it’s encouraged as there are many hidden rooms with goodies in them. When you stumble upon one, the camera changes path and leads you into the room briefly, then once it’s scrolled all the way through, begin making it’s way back to the main path.</div><br/><div>The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-180\" href=\"/heads-up-display/3015-180\" slug=\"heads-up-display\">HUD</a> shows your  score, lives, your current  weapon, how many upgrades of that weapon you have picked up as well as a bar that fills up whenever you pick up \"Cobalt Bombs\". The Cobalt Bombs are sometimes dropped by enemies and if you can fill said bar, you will attain an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\" href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806\" slug=\"extra-life\">extra life</a>. You can also press the A button if the bar is somewhat filled to do a  special attack which clears everything off the screen.</div><br/><div>As you play the game there will be <a data-ref-id=\"3015-133\" href=\"/upgradeable-weapons/3015-133\" slug=\"upgradeable-weapons\">weapon upgrades</a> that flash between the three possible weapons. You can continue to pick them up until that specific weapon upgrades to a better version. The first upgrade will occur when you pick up 5 and the last upgrade when you pick up 10.</div><div><h2>Weapon Details</h2><div><div><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Starter Weapon</b>: The typical weapon, like any in any other shooter. The starter weapon shoots bullets the length of the screen.<br/></li></ul></div><br/><div><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Laser</b>: The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-140\" href=\"/laser/3055-140\" slug=\"laser\">Laser</a> can be compared to the starting weapon in that it shoots a straight line and goes the distance of the screen until hitting an obstacle. At the first weapon change you shoot two beams, one in the direction you’re aiming and another in the opposite direction. The last upgrade allows you to shoot four laser beams in an X pattern.<br/></li></ul></div><br/><div><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Ring</b>: When using the Ring you shoot a circular disc that can go through walls; the starter weapon also shoots when using the Ring. The first upgrade shoots rings the direction you’re aiming and the opposite direction. The last upgrade makes you shoot a disc in the opposite direction you're aiming and a spread of three rings the direction you are aiming.<br/></li></ul></div><br/><div><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Missile</b>: The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-74\" href=\"/missile/3055-74\" slug=\"missile\">Missile</a> is similar to the Ring in that when you shoot it, you also shoot the starter weapon. The missile however always shoots forward, even if you are aiming in a different direction. The first upgrade makes missiles shoot to the left and to the right. The final upgrade shoots missiles in every central direction; up, down, left and right.<br/></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",

At the time, the series' graphical capabilities and gameplay mechanics were considered revolutionary and innovative for PCs. Wizardry III continues the story begun with the first game and allows players to import characters in from <a href=\"../../wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/61-9180/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wizardry I</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16625\" href=\"/wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds/3030-16625\" slug=\"wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds\">Wizardry II</a> to continue the quest in a new scenario. Unlike previous games, however, players CANNOT create new characters in this game. They must import characters from either of the previous two games. The mechanics, detailed below, remained the same.</p><p style=\"\">After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers in a bid to survive the challenges of another dangerous dungeon in a bid to find the dragon, L'Kbreth, and recover the Orb of Earithin to help the Sages of the High Council discover the cause of the disasters facing the City of Llylgamyn. The gameplay style of the title has been compared to that of a dungeon crawl in which players simply fight monsters for experience and treasure. It is exactly the same as the first game, only now with a different scenario.</p><p style=\"\">The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen.</p><p style=\"\">Players could import characters from either <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9180\" href=\"/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/3030-9180\" slug=\"wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16625\" href=\"/wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds/3030-16625\" slug=\"wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds\">Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds</a>. It would be the last game in the \"Werdna\" arc to allow players in doing so. As a part of the story, the imported characters are referred to as the descendants of the original characters in order to maintain continuity.</p><p style=\"\">Among the other features of the game were:</p><ul><li>Over 50 spells were available for casting</li><li>4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to</li><li>5 races to create classes with</li></ul><p style=\"\">The game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed. The console iterations of the game, such as that released for the NES, featured better graphics particularly in replacing the wireframe dungeon visuals.</p><p style=\"\">The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text. A section walked a player through a fictional scenario that might occur within the game while explaining its concepts with several examples.</p><p style=\"\">The NES version, by an odd twist of fate, was the second Wizardry game to be released for that system. It was called Wizardry II: The Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario to reflect that it was both the second Wizardry game for the system and the third game overall. The actual Wizardry II would be released for NES later as Wizardry: The Knight of Diamonds - The Second Scenario, without the numeric.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581281-wizardry_menu_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581281\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581281-wizardry_menu_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581281\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581281-wizardry_menu_1_.gif\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Wizardry's story is firmly rooted within fantasy and is considered the second module in a set of four linked by a story arc that would end with <a href=\"../../wizardry-iv-the-return-of-werdna/61-7113/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna</a>. Legacy of Llylgamyn takes place a generation following the events of the second game, although experience with it was not necessary to begin this scenario.</p><p style=\"\">A generation has passed since a brave band of adventurers had managed to regain the fabled armor of the Knight of Diamonds and return the legendary artifact, the Staff of Gnilda, to its rightful place in protecting the city from evil. Under its power, the City of Llylgamyn has become a place of light and beauty where war and the horror that it brings have become long forgotten. But the peace has been rocked by nature gone awry. Over the past several years, freak earthquakes, changes in climate, and thundering storms have reached the ears of the kingdom's people. Most have ignored them.</p><p style=\"\">But when the gentle seas surrounding the prosperous island colony of Arbithea suddenly rose and swamped the island, no one could ignore these signs for much longer. The tidal wave had washed away Arbithea's cities leaving only its highest peaks above the roiling waves. Soon after, Llylgamyn itself was shaken by an earthquake so powerful that the sacred Temple of Gnilda was damaged. Nearby, ancient volcanoes rumbled themselves awake. Soon, self-appointed prophets spoke of divine wrath, demanding that the people repent. Mystics consulted the Tarot, astrologers warned of great comets falling from the heavens bringing with them utter destruction, and priests of the old religions talk of the death of the Great World Serpent and the end of existence.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581271-1170421372_01_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581271\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581271-1170421372_01_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581271\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581271-1170421372_01_1_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581271-1170421372_01_1_.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Wiser heads called for a new generation of adventurers from all walks of life and creeds to seek the cause of these troubles. Like their ancestors long before them, these new adventurers would quest to save Llylgamyn from the perils facing the mighty city. The greatest Sages and Wizards of the kingdom came together and had agreed that only one thing could reveal the truth behind the dangers facing them: a mystical orb taken by the mighty dragon, L'Kbreth. L'Kbreth, one the World Serpent's five children, is dedicated to the preservation of balance in the world and had deemed that the great orb, left in mankind's hands, might upset the balance. According to legend, the dragon took the orb with her to her lair and there, invoked the powers of both good and evil to protect it from would-be thieves.</p><p style=\"\">The leaders of Llylgamyn appeal to these new adventurers, the descendants of the heroes and heroines of the Knight of Diamonds, the children of the survivors of the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, to take up their memories and their skills to seek out L'Kbreth. Only by facing the dragon and beseeching its aid may they receive the Orb of Earithin.</p><p style=\"\">These new adventurers proudly step forward and accept the burden given to them by the Elders. Aided by the spirits of their ancestors, they feel confident that they will be able to succeed. From this day forward, they will take the name of their legendary forefathers and through a mystical ceremony, will be able to speak with their spirit and ask for guidance. But from then on, they and their fellow descendants will be alone. They must make their way to the ruined palace and from there, climb their way to the top of the mountain. But only both good and evil can hope to reclaim the Orb.</p><p style=\"\">After many adventures, such a party did succeed in facing the dangers of the dungeon. By solving riddles, they created a magical crystal that allowed them to pass the dragon, L'Kbreth, who greeted them as heroes. A final riddle faced them before the Orb could be theirs and by answering it, were able to reclaim the relic and return with it to the City of Llylgamyn.</p><p style=\"\">With the Orb of Earithin, the Sages of Llylgamyn will be able to find the true cause of the disasters facing the kingdom. In appreciation for their help, Queen Beyki, gave each party member the Star of Llylgamyn and invited they and others to share in the reward for a hard fought end to their quest.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581279-1170421372_00_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581279\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581279-1170421372_00_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581279\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581279-1170421372_00_1_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581279-1170421372_00_1_.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Wizardry III is exactly the same as its predecessor; a tile, or <a href=\"../../grid-based-movement/92-1318/\" rel=\"nofollow\">grid based movement</a>, first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of a new dungeon in order to find the dragon, L'Kbreth, and recover the legendary Orb of Earithin.</p><p style=\"\">Wizardry III, however, was aimed squarely at veterans that had experienced either <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9180\" href=\"/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/3030-9180\" slug=\"wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\">Wizardry I</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16625\" href=\"/wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds/3030-16625\" slug=\"wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds\">Wizardry II</a>. This was reflected in the fact that only characters created in either of those titles could start the game.</p><p style=\"\">The dungeon comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.</p><p style=\"\">Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry III's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party of imported characters, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them. This was also treated as a backup in case of PC failure. The party would be marked as OUT until the player decided to restart the group or create another party of adventurers and headed down to find them.</p><p style=\"\">Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.</p><h3><u>The Castle</u></h3><p style=\"\">This was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey:</p><ul><li>Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.</li><li>Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.</li><li>Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful.</li><li>Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's \"uncursed.\"</li><li>Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.</li><li>The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze otherwise known as the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.</li><li>Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own.</li></ul><h3><u>Picking Locks and Disarming Traps</u></h3><p style=\"\">There were no locks to pick in the game. Disarming traps, on the other hand, on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed. Spells could also be used to help disarm chests.</p><h3><u>Camping</u></h3><p style=\"\">This command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose.</p><h2>Character Development</h2><p style=\"\">Unlike previous games in the series, players had to import characters into Wizardry III from either <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9180\" href=\"/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/3030-9180\" slug=\"wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\">Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16625\" href=\"/wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds/3030-16625\" slug=\"wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds\">Knight of Diamonds</a>. All of the other mechanics, however, remained the same.</p><h3><u>Age</u></h3><p style=\"\">Characters can actually age in Wizardry II if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold you have in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.</p><h3><u>Alignment</u></h3><p style=\"\">Although alignment was a choice that helped to determine what classes a character could become, it has an expanded role in Wizardry III. Party mix was now impacted by the alignment of its member characters (good and evil characters would be unable to be in the same party, although they could be a member of a neutral one). Certain areas within the dungeon were accessible only to parties of certain alignments.</p><p style=\"\">The second and fourth levels of the dungeon, in particular, were only accessible by parties with no evil characters among their ranks. The sixth, and final, level could only be accessed by a party with at least one character devoted to either good or evil. Neutral parties were able to traverse into all areas except for the final level.</p><h3><u>Imported Characters: The Legacy</u></h3><p style=\"\">Imported characters were treated as descendants of the original adventurers that had traveled the dungeons of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9180\" href=\"/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/3030-9180\" slug=\"wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\">Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</a> or had quested to recover the armor of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16625\" href=\"/wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds/3030-16625\" slug=\"wizardry-ii-the-knight-of-diamonds\">Knight of Diamonds</a>. They would basically start out as first level characters with only the barest of essentials as if they had begun as a freshly rolled party.</p><h3><u>Classes</u></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581273-1170421371_03_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/581273-1170421371_03_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-581273\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581273-1170421371_03_1_.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15693/581273-1170421371_03_1_.png\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.</p><p style=\"\">As with the first game (and what would become an integral part of its gameplay formula), Wizardry III includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).</p><p style=\"\">Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be.</p><p style=\"\">The four basic classes are:</p><ul><li><b>Fighter</b> - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.</li><li><b>Thief</b> - No party is complete without a competent thief to help disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.</li><li><b>Priest</b> - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They cannot be of neutral alignment.</li><li><b>Mage</b> - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells.</li></ul><p style=\"\">The four elite classes are:</p><ul><li><b>Bishop</b> - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But they can identify items without fear of being cursed. They must not be neutral.</li><li><b>Samurai</b> - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.</li><li><b>Lord</b> - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.</li><li><b>Ninja</b> - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment.</li></ul><h3><u>Races</u></h3><p style=\"\">The races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit. Although Wizardry III's characters were imported, the race descriptions below were still useful references for players.</p><ul><li><b>Humans</b> - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.</li><li><b>Elf</b> - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.</li><li><b>Dwarf</b> - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.</li><li><b>Gnomes</b> - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.</li><li><b>Hobbit</b> - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.</li></ul><h3><u>Statistics</u></h3><p style=\"\">Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.</p><ul><li><b>Strength</b> - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them.

The player can choose to take on the eight robot masters in any order they choose. Each robot master is weak to another's special weapon, and it is up to the player to experiment and discover what will best work against his foes. Mega Man begins with only his mega buster weapon, but as he progresses, he will earn new weapons from each robot master that he defeats. Mega Man 3 is also known for the addition of the slide move, which became a staple of later iterations. The game also introduces a new Rush power, the Rush sub, which allows Mega Man to travel through water.</p><p style=\"\">Each stage in the game employs a variety of new obstacles which Mega Man must conquer. These include low walls that must be slid under, tricky jumps, and the infamous disappearing block sections.</p><p style=\"\">Mega Man 3 is host to an interesting <a href=\"/glitch/3015-511\" data-ref-id=\"3015-511\">glitch </a>in which Mega Man can leap the height of the entire screen if players plugged in a second NES controller and held down RIGHT on its d-pad. The actual jumping ability was probably a hidden <a href=\"/cheat-code/3015-237\" data-ref-id=\"3015-237\">cheat</a>; the actual glitch comes in handy when the player dies by falling into a <a href=\"/pit/3015-848\" data-ref-id=\"3015-848\">bottomless pit</a>. With proper timing, players could then attempt to jump out of the pit using the cheat, sending Mega Man back into the playing field with a completely empty life bar. The result is an invincible Mega Man; while he still reels back from contact, he is able to take an infinite amount of punishment in this condition. Two caveats: (a) Mega Man can no longer fire off his Mega buster, and must make use of his nemeses' weaponry--and if he is out of \"ammo\" in this condition, he's practically useless on the offensive end; (b) Mega Man is still vulnerable to spikes. Also, grabbing a life powerup while in this state will fill up some of Mega Man's energy bar, making him once again vulnerable to attacks (and possibly very near death, if a small life powerup was picked up).</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p style=\"\">Below are the Robot Masters unique to Mega Man 3. Like all classic Mega Man games, Mega Man gains each robot master's weapon when they are defeated. In an oddity for the series, the vulnerability relationships in Mega Man 3 aren't entirely circular: That is, there is not one solitary sequence for defeating the robot masters from beginning to end with the luxury of having the appropriate weapon (past the first fight). In other words, at some point even after the first boss fight, players will have to walk into a robot master encounter with a sub-optimal weapon. Note that in Dr. Wily's castle, players encounter 8 additional Robot Masters from Mega Man 2 but they do not have full stages, nor do they have useable weapons.</p><h3>Top Man</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/245484-top_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245484\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8641975308642\" data-width=\"162\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 162px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/245484-top_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-245484\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2598/245484-top_man_profile.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2598/245484-top_man_profile.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Top Man.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><strong>Weak Against:</strong> Hard Knuckle</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Main attacks:</strong> Top Man will throw out multiple tops that hover in the air before zoning in on Mega Man in a straight line.

The recognizable theme from the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2 would return in Mega Man 4, but would change again for Mega Man 5 and Mega Man 6.</li><li>Mega Man would previously storm Dr. Wily's castle immediately after the demise of the final robot master in Mega Man and Mega Man 2. However, Mega Man 3 started the trend of delaying this inevitable assault by one stanza. Here, Mega Man has to fight through the eight reincarnations of the Mega Man 2 robots as well as face off with \"Break Man\" before heading to Wily himself. (In subsequent NES games, Dr. Cossack, Proto Man and Mr. X would masquerade as the \"lead villains\" before Dr. Wily was unsurprisingly revealed as the true mastermind behind all of the events that were taking place.)</li><li>Mega Man 3 marks the franchise debut of the aforementioned Proto Man as Mega Man's brother.</li><li>Mega Man 3 changed the sound effect, in relation to its predecessors, that plays when Mega Man lands on the ground from a jump or a fall.</li><li>Mega Man 3 changed the sound effect, in relation to its predecessors, that plays when Mega Man is hit.</li><li>Mega Man 3 changed the sound effect and appearance, in relation to its predecessors, of Mega Man's explosion--as well as those of other robot masters--upon death. The \"bubbles\" that burst outward travel faster, and sport a cleaner, larger look. In addition, defeated robot masters explode with the same white bursts as Mega Man does; in previous games, those bursts are tinged with the color scheme of the robot master.</li><li>Mega Man 3 increased the speed at which Mega Man climbed ladders from its predecessors.</li><li>Mega Man 3 used a very slightly less abrasive sound effect for recharging life meters from its predecessors.</li><li>Mega Man 3 changed the way Mega Man's mega-buster shots collided with boss characters. In previous entries, the sound effects were employed such that Mega Man's shots wouldn't register as a \"hit\" while the boss character's hit burst appeared on the screen. (About the \"hit burst\": every time players hit a robot master with a shot, a white flash would emanate from its body, indicating a successful hit.) In Mega Man 3, the sound effects made it sound as if every shot fired came in contact with a robot master, instead of having some shots \"pass through.\" However, as in previous games, only shots that resulted in the hit burst would deplete the boss characters' energy meter.</li></ul>",

The music in the game was composed by Hideki Kanazashi under the alias 'Escaper Kanazashi'.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6644/483787-airfortress05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483787\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.95127118644068\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6644/483787-airfortress05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483787\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6644/483787-airfortress05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Shoot-em-Up Gameplay</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Air Fortress contains two different forms of gameplay that repeats over each of the eight levels.</p><h3>Shoot-em-Up</h3><p style=\"\">Upon entering each air fortress, the gameplay is a side-scrolling shooter with basic enemies and two different kinds of power-ups: Energy and Crash beams (represented by a bubble with either an E or B inside, respectively). Each energy bubble provides 100 extra energy points, while the crash beam bubble will provide 5 more shots of the crash beam. These power-ups are intended for use once inside the fortress proper. The player has three attempts to enter an air lock which is located at the end of each level. The ship will automatically lock on to this. Once locked on, the air lock allows the player to go inside the fortress.</p><h3>Platformer</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6644/483789-airfortress06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483789\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.93697478991597\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6644/483789-airfortress06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-483789\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6644/483789-airfortress06.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Platformer Gameplay</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At this point the gameplay changes to the feel of an action adventure game, almost like a miniature Metroid style game. The player has two weapons at their disposal: A regular gun and a more powerful shot, the crash beam. The regular gun is unlimited, however the number of crash beam shots are based upon how many that were collected during the shoot-em-up section, though more are available to collect in this mode.</p><p style=\"\">There is no jumping in the traditional sense, but the player can activate their rocket pack to move around vertically. Any movements and shooting made inside the fortress take away energy, though resting will regenerate the energy up to its maximum level. However, getting hit by an enemy will bring the total energy amount down, which will not recover with rest. At the end of each fortress is an energy core which must be destroyed. Once it is gone, there is a limited amount of time to find a vehicle and escape.</p><p style=\"\">Air Fortress contained a password system to allow players to continue from where they left off.</p><p style=\"\">After completing the game there is a second quest available with the same level layouts, but with more difficult enemies.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">The following is taken verbatim from the opening text before starting the game:</p><blockquote><p style=\"\">The inhabitants of the planet Farmel have lived in peace since the establishment of the stardate calendar. They have traveled all around the galaxy with a new style spacecraft called the lightship. Then one day the peace was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress. it was living and destroying all the other civilizations. The federation of intergalactic power organized the defense forces immediately.</p><p style=\"\">The federation forces were no match for the superior defenses of the air fortress. The fortreses totally destroyed all of the federation forces. The federation decided to select a specially trained person ID82592 named Hal Bailman. Hal's equipment includes a newly developed light blaster and armored suit. Now Hal departs to destroy the fortress and save Farmel.</p></blockquote><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The lead character's name is Hal, from the developer of Air Fortress, HAL Laboratory.</li><li>If the game was purchased directly from the publisher, a free Air Fortress shirt could be sent to the buyer.</li></ul>",

In each mission the wanted criminal is shown briefly before absconding and its up to the player to direct the policeman around using the Power Pad buttons in order to track the criminal down. This involves going left and right, turning 90 degrees to enter different areas (when available) and turning 180 degrees to reverse direction. Players can also find items like aluminum cans, which can be thrown at criminals as well. Defeating all of the criminal's lackeys will force them to reveal themselves, allowing the player to arrest them and finish the level.</p>",

Additional credits do not let the player continue the game.</p><h3>Items</h3><p style=\"\">Almost every floor in the game contains an item which can be obtained after meeting certain criteria, such as defeating enemies or reaching a certain area on the maze. Most items are absolutely crucial in continuing the game and some are necessary to obtain items later in the game. Items include things such as Pickaxes which can destroy walls, Jet Boots which increase the players movement speed, Necklaces or Rings which protect the player from certain enemies and of course more powerful swords. All items are passive, with the only item that could be destroyed being the Pickaxe. They break if the player uses them more than a certain amount of times per level, or by striking an outside wall. They can be upgraded throughout the game and the Gold Pickaxe can be used an unlimited amount of times, but can still be destroyed when using on an outside wall. The acquisition of certain items can be extremely vague and guides exist on the internet which detail how to obtain each item.</p><h3>Enemies</h3><p style=\"\">Enemies in the are basic at the beginning of the game, but progressively become tougher as they change color, either gaining new abilities or more health. Most enemies will fire projectiles of sorts and in order to block them, the player must be facing the direction of the projective with his sword unsheathed. The player can block the projectiles with their sword drawn, providing they are facing to the side of the projectile. Some enemies will shoot fire, which only travels a short distance but will burn for a short period of time, creating an obstacle for the player. The player can move through the fire if they obtain the Red Necklace.</p><ul><li><b>Slime:</b> The game's basic enemy. They will kill the player on contact, but are otherwise easy to deal with. If the player is standing still while the slime is moving into their block, they will die. They get tougher as the game progresses: Red slimes will shoot projectiles and Dark Green slimes can fire projectiles that pass through walls.</li><li><b>Knight:</b> Slightly more vicious than the slime, they require more hits to take down and are more agile. As the game progresses they become tougher and more agile, such as the Black Knight. There is another enemy known as Lizard Men, but they behave identically to Knights.</li><li><b>Magician:</b> They teleport around the stage and shoot black magic at the player, who must face the projectile in order to block it. Druids (white) can break walls and Wizards (orange) can fire projectiles through walls.</li><li><b>Ghost:</b> Similar Magicians but tougher and can also move through walls. In order to see them, the player must obtain a candle.</li><li><b>Roper:</b> Slime-like creatures with tentacles that take a lot of hits to take down. They will kill the player if they are stationary. They later appear in blue form, which cannot be killed and will kill the player if they try to attack them. However, they can be safely passed through.</li><li><b>Will-O-Wisp:</b> When the timer runs out, they will appear and chase the player. The player can still reach the exist before they kill them, however. They appear later in the game as regular enemies and the player can be protected from them by obtaining rings.</li><li><b>Dragon:</b> Will move slowly around the level, breathing fire. The player can move through the dragon without dying, but cannot block the fire. The game's music changes on each stage they appear.</li><li><b>Succubus:</b> A demon with the appearance of a priestess, appearing only twice in the game. Players will die if they touch them, but can be killed and are otherwise harmless.</li><li><b>Druaga:</b> The final boss. Extremely quick, can cast spells and can attack the player.</li></ul><h3>Differences in the PC Engine remake</h3><p style=\"\">As well as receiving a graphical update, the game also grants the user a password system, the ability to select a difficulty and equip items. The player can also increase certain stats at the end of each level which include health, attack power, defense power, agility, speed and pickax. The game was fan-translated in 2007 and the patch is <a href=\"http://www.romhacking.net/trans/1104/\" rel=\"nofollow\">available here</a>.</p><h2>Music</h2><p style=\"\">The music and sound effects to the game were composed and designed by <a href=\"/junko-ozawa/3040-2736\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2736\">Junko Ozawa</a>. The game's music has been compiled in two releases.

      "deck": "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a side-scrolling NES game loosely based on the original novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. Gameplay alternates between controlling Jekyll or Hyde, as they walk across town to reach Dr. Jekyll's wedding.",
      "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is an action-orientated, <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\"> side-scrolling</a> game developed by <a href=\"/bandai-co-ltd/3010-272\" data-ref-id=\"3010-272\"> Bandai Co.</a>, first released in 1988 in Japan on the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\"> Famicom Disk System</a>, before gaining a US release on the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\"> NES</a> in 1989. The game is based very loosely upon the 1886 novel <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">What story the game has is detailed in its manual; the game itself features no expository text to explain the scenario, though it is very loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Dr. Jekyll has created a potion that has separated the good and evil aspects of his personality. When he is happy, he will remain as himself, but when he becomes angry, he is transformed into the homicidal and violent Mr. Hyde. The basic plot follows Dr. Jekyll's attempts to reach his <a href=\"/marriage/3015-2422\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2422\"> wedding</a> with the charming Miss Millicent, on the other side of town. Initially, he sets out from his house with his walking stick towards the church. Along the way, a variety of citizens, animals and other obstacles attempt to impede his progress, causing him to either become hurt and/or more angry. When his anger reaches a critical threshold, Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde, and the world becomes nightmarish alternative-reality. Furthermore, Hyde walks in the opposite direction to Jekyll, away from the church. If Hyde manages to kill the monsters and demons, his anger level returns to normal and Hyde morphs back into Jekyll. If Hyde does not dispose of the monsters or is attacked himself, he is suddenly struck by a bolt of <a href=\"/lightning/3055-1807\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1807\"> lightning</a> and the game ends.</p><p style=\"\">The game includes two <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\"> possible endings</a>. The standard ending will happen if and when Dr. Jekyll reaches the church at the climax of the sixth level. Jekyll then marries Miss Millicent and presumably lives happily ever after. The alternative ending can occur only if Mr. Hyde reaches the church (which is usually not possible given that Hyde is struck by lightning if he progresses further than Jekyll; the exception is the second half of the final level). A <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\"> boss monster</a> named Letule will appear in the form of a floating head, and if successfully defeated, Hyde will transform back into Jekyll and can marry Millicent in an elongated wedding ceremony. The ending shows a bolt of lightning with a silhouette of Hyde and a cross behind him, seeming to indicate that Dr. Jekyll's evil persona has been vanquished once and for all.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The game consists of six levels, but the ordering of the levels differs between the original Japanese and North American version of the game. The Japanese version includes the levels <a href=\"/city/3035-2093\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2093\"> City</a>, <a href=\"/park/3035-2094\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2094\"> Park</a>, <a href=\"/alley/3035-2388\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2388\"> Alley</a>, <a href=\"/town/3035-1244\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1244\"> Town</a>, <a href=\"/cemetery/3035-1552\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1552\"> Cemetery</a> and <a href=\"/the-street/3035-1045\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1045\"> Street</a>. However, the North American version removes the City level and instead duplicates the Cemetery level, leading to an order of Town, Cemetery, Alley, Park, Cemetery and Street. The character of Dr. Jekyll walks to the right, and can <a href=\"/jump/3015-379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\"> jump</a> to avoid obstacles, and can also jab with his walking stick. However, the stick is useless against most enemies, and is only capable of damaging angry <a href=\"/bee/3015-1847\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1847\"> bees</a>. Therefore, most of the Jekyll gameplay comprises of jumping to avoid coming into contact with enemies, since defeating them is impossible.</p><p style=\"\">As Mr. Hyde, the game <a href=\"/auto-scrolling-levels/3015-2299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2299\"> auto-scrolls</a> to the left and the level is mirrored backwards with a darker color palette. Hyde can jump much higher than Jekyll, but more importantly can also punch and throw a special ball which the box art describes as a Psycho-Wave which can kill enemies at a distance. The goal while playing as Hyde is to kill demons as quickly as possible to relieve the anger meter so that he may transform back into Jekyll. If the meter is not lowered quickly enough, or Hyde's life is depleted, he is struck by lightning and the game ends.</p><p style=\"\">If the player advances further through the stage as Hyde than previously as Jekyll, it counts as Jekyll's evil side triumphing, and Hyde is struck by lightning and killed. During the Hyde sections, it is also possible to pick up <a href=\"/coin/3055-219\" data-ref-id=\"3055-219\"> coins</a> occasionally dropped by defeated enemies. These coins then may be used by Jekyll to ward off certain citizens and avoid possible encounters.</p><h2>Impact</h2><p style=\"\">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is regularly considered for inclusion on lists of Worst Games Ever, alongside such titles as <a href=\"/superman/3030-20702\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20702\"> Superman</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\"> Nintendo 64</a> and <a href=\"/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/3030-19987\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19987\"> Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing</a>. Its virtual unplayability and seeming impossibility to complete, repetitive music (one song for each mode in the entire game), highly sluggish controls and the bizarre decision not to give Dr. Jekyll any kind of weaponry with which to defend himself (aside from a useless walking stick), are usually cited as the main reasons. Nonetheless, it has developed a small cult following amongst aficionados of NES games.</p><p style=\"\">In 2009, IGN voted Dr. Jekyll's box art as the third scariest ever, behind <a href=\"/carmageddon/3030-18394\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18394\"> Carmageddon</a> for the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\"> Game Boy Color</a> and <a href=\"/freshly-picked-tingles-rosy-rupeeland/3030-21239\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21239\"> Freshly-Picked: Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland</a> on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\"> Nintendo DS</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Gold Medal Challenge '92 was a Capcom game that was released shortly before the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona. There were 12 countries represented in the game, with 18 different events to compete in. The majority were Track and Field events, but also included Swimming, Weightlifting and Gymnastics. Gold Medal Challenge '92 had a battery back-up system that allowed the user to save their progress in the World Tournament mode as well as any world records set while playing. The game allowed up to 8 human players to control different countries with 2 players competing at the same time in an event.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Game Modes</h2><p style=\"\"><strong>World Tournament </strong></p><p style=\"\">World Tournament ran through every event on the game. It was broken up into different programs. Each program consisted of 3 events and 1 round of the Marathon. After each program, an updated medal table would be shown. Also, after each program, the player had the ability to save progress.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Training </strong></p><p style=\"\">Practice mode.

The runner had a set energy bar, so based on a few factors (how much speed, elevations) the energy bar would drop at varying rates. When the runner's energy bar went empty, the runner would drop to the lowest speed possible and normally fall way behind.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Events</h2><p style=\"\"><strong>Track </strong></p><ul><li>100 Meter Dash</li><li>200 Meter Dash</li><li>400 Meter Dash</li><li>4 x 100 Meter Relay</li><li>110 Meter Hurdles</li><li>Marathon</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Field </strong></p><ul><li>Long Jump</li><li>Triple Jump</li><li>High Jump</li><li>Javelin Throw</li><li>Shot Put</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Swimming </strong></p><ul><li>100 Meter Freestyle</li><li>100 Meter Breast</li><li>100 Meter Backstroke</li><li>100 Meter Butterfly</li><li>200 Meter Medley (50 Meters of Each)</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Gymnastics</strong></p><ul><li>Vaulting Horse</li></ul><p style=\"\"><strong>Weightlifting</strong></p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Countries</h2><p style=\"\">There were 12 countries to choose from, the only differences between countries were the character models.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Countries</th><th scope=\"col\"> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">The United States of America</a></td><td><a href=\"/russia/3035-38\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russia</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/china/3035-343\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China</a></td><td><a href=\"/canada/3035-244\" data-ref-id=\"3035-244\">Canada</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/united-kingdom/3035-492\" data-ref-id=\"3035-492\">Great Britain</a></td><td><a href=\"/france/3035-197\" data-ref-id=\"3035-197\">France</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/germany/3035-281\" data-ref-id=\"3035-281\">Germany</a></td><td>Romania</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/bulgaria/3035-3409\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3409\">Bulgaria</a></td><td><a href=\"/hungary/3035-2260\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2260\">Hungary</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"/spain/3035-527\" data-ref-id=\"3035-527\">Spain</a></td><td><a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a></td></tr></tbody></table>",

      "description": "<p style=\"\">Short Order/Eggsplode gives you two games on a single cartridge, offering not only a unique opportunity to dig out and unfold your <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2753\" href=\"/power-pad/3015-2753\" slug=\"power-pad\">Power Pad</a>, but also - as the package is careful to note - Family Fun. We'll take them individually.</p><h2>Short Order</h2><p style=\"\">Short Order is a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10131\" href=\"/simon/3030-10131\" slug=\"simon\">Simon</a>-style memory game in which the player prepares tall, perfectly vertical burgers for a variety of anthropomorphic animal diners ranging in girth from mouse to pig. Each desires their signature burger: Dog Burger, Pig Burger, Mouse Burger, what have you. Burgers are composed of meat, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes; each of these is assigned a pair of Power Pad buttons, and the player stacks up the burger by jumping on those pair (or, if you're lazy, sitting on the floor and smacking them with your palms).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/108953/1828429-shortorder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828429\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0061728395062\" data-width=\"162\" style=\"width: 162px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/108953/1828429-shortorder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1828429\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/108953/1828429-shortorder.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I think that's a turtle.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>1-2 adds a meat patty to the burger;</li><li>3-4 adds cheese;</li><li>5-6 adds tomato;</li><li>7-8 adds lettuce.</li></ul><p style=\"\">As in Simon, the diner spells out a sequence of ingredients (as the little animal avatar jumps around an on-screen representation of the Power Pad to demonstrate). Repeat this sequence exactly, and you're given another; same as the last one, but with one new ingredient added to the end. This goes on until you make three mistakes, which makes steam shoot out of the animal's ears; or, stack a burger tall enough to satisfy them, which makes the burger fly up into the air, land in the animal's waiting mouth and, after a few seconds of chewing, annihilate their metabolism, causing them to balloon into an amusing shape. Family Fun indeed.</p><p style=\"\">The game also scores you; one point for every mistake you made while stacking the burger. At the time of writing there is no leaderboard support.</p><h2>Eggsplode!</h2><p style=\"\">Eggsplode is a less awkward adaptation of the Power Pad input. You are the caretaker of a chicken coop containing a dozen hens, arranged so that each hen corresponds to a button on the Power Pad. This coop is under assault by multiple foxes who are attempting to sabotage your livelihood by planting big round cartoon bombs under the chickens, which you disarm by stepping on the chicken's button. After a certain number of bombs have been safely removed, the level is completed, and you advance to another level with a faster pace and a larger number of bombs to disarm. If a bomb explodes, the game ends as the now-featherless, smoldering chicken flaps around.</p><p style=\"\">In the midst of this assault, the chickens continue to lay eggs. Step on an egg and the chicken gets very angry (again with the steam coming out of the ears) and the foxes laugh at you. Step on three eggs and the game is over. Also, the dog from Short Order is running around the coop, probably just trying to help, but sometimes he switches eggs in for bombs, often at the wrong moment.</p><p style=\"\">This game can be enjoyed by as many people as you can comfortably fit on the Power Pad at once. As far as anyone knows, it keeps going until you lose.</p>",

A single-screen platformer game, the stages are a series of platforms with sections that are made of components of a mighty hamburger. These ingredients are placed in the level vertically so that, as the player character walked across them, they would drop until eventually making a complete sandwich at the bottom of the screen. The finished burgers are such titans that it dwarfs the player character. Of note, the servers who would carry this burger to the customers are never shown.</p><p style=\"\">The player controls Peter Pepper, a chef whose objective is to walk, climb and scurry all over the platforms in order to build his burgers. As the chef walks completely across the top of a layer, it will drops one level below, thus knocking the layer beneath down one level also. After all the layers have been dropped onto the platters awaiting below, the burger is complete and the player's score is boosted. When all hamburgers are completed, only then is the level clear. </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7025/349827-burger_time.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-349827\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7025/349827-burger_time.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-349827\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7025/349827-burger_time.gif\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">As with most of the games of the time, the levels become more complex and difficult as the player progresses. This is accomplished through varied platform layouts, more enemies, and an ever-increasing number of burger components. Just like in real life, no-one orders a plain cheeseburger forever. While the chef fights to keep his customers fed and happy, he is besieged by three malcontents of the food industry: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle and Mr. Egg. These 3 can be killed temporarily by dropping a layer of the burger on top of them but it is a short-term solution as they reappear at the edge of the screen after a short time. A crafty chef can also make the fiends chase him across a partially walked across layer and then complete it as the enemy steps on to it. The layer will then drop along with the enemy whose weight causes it to drop two levels as opposed to just one. An added benefit to this technique is that it temporarily stuns the enemy. It's possible to crush other enemies beneath the falling enemy and burger as well. Peter Pepper also has a small supply of pepper he can throw in the enemies face to render them harmless for a few seconds. Additional pepper can be acquired by picking up ice cream and other items that will randomly spawn on the level.</p><p style=\"\">PizzaTime, the hotly anticipated sequel was in development when the video game market went into a decline, and sadly was never released.</p>",

To collect this gold, Bubbles has to use certain posts that can turn him around. These are located at intervals throughout each level (only a few pixels apart), and are just wide enough for Bubbles to fit through. The enemies, Unira, can be stunned if Bubbles uses an attack, and then pushed into a wall to kill them. <br />",

Featuring new renditions of the songs from the NES version of the game, including arranged songs and a pop remix of the opening theme, with vocals sung by Manami Morozumi.

The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).</p><p style=\"\">In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).</p><h3>NES Version</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392476\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-392476\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/392476-dd2021.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by <a href=\"/acclaim-entertainment-inc/3010-88\" data-ref-id=\"3010-88\">Acclaim Entertainment</a> and developed by <a href=\"/technos-japan-corp/3010-452\" data-ref-id=\"3010-452\">Technos</a>, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).</p><p style=\"\">The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute \"hyper\" uppercut and \"hyper\" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.</p><p style=\"\">Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player \"Mode B\", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the <a href=\"/speedrun/3015-179\" data-ref-id=\"3015-179\">speedrun</a> community. (Another side effect of \"Mode B\" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><p style=\"\">Other than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the <a href=\"/sega/3010-62\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.</p><p style=\"\">Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with <a href=\"/virgin-mastertronic-ltd/3010-171\" data-ref-id=\"3010-171\">Virgin Mastertronic</a> and <a href=\"/binary-design-ltd/3010-496\" data-ref-id=\"3010-496\">Binary Design</a> handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317956\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.98591549295775\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317956\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1317956-1162_809582.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Dead or Alive (2:48)</li><li>The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)</li><li>A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)</li><li>Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)</li><li>Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)</li><li>Escape to the Forest (3:43)</li><li>Wicked God (1:25)</li><li>Breaking the Barrier (2:37)</li><li>Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)</li><li>Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)</li><li>Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)</li><li>Sweet Memories (3:13)</li></ol>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! is a <a href=\"/boxer/3015-13\" data-ref-id=\"3015-13\">boxing</a> game developed by <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a> and released in 1987 for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. <a href=\"/little-mac/3005-357\" data-ref-id=\"3005-357\">Little Mac</a>, a diminutive boxer in the World Video Boxing Association, works his way through three title circuits on his quest to become the WVBA's next champion. Although the game's mechanics and many of its opponents are taken directly from Nintendo's prior arcade title <a href=\"/punch-out/3030-27410\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27410\">Punch-Out!!</a>, this home console version sports a flatter graphical style more suited to the hardware limitations of the <a href=\"/8-bit/3015-5951\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5951\">eight-bit</a> NES. The original release of NES Punch-Out!! is also notable for featuring the name and likeness of real-life former Heavyweight champion <a href=\"/mike-tyson/3040-89763\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89763\">Mike Tyson</a> as the game's <a href=\"/final-boss/3015-1537\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1537\">final boss</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14027/593185-mike_20tyson_s_20punch_20out.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-593185\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14027/593185-mike_20tyson_s_20punch_20out.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-593185\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14027/593185-mike_20tyson_s_20punch_20out.png\"></a><figcaption>Glass Joe, Little Mac's first opponent</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Although Mike Tyson's Punch Out!! utilizes many of the trappings seen in the real-world sport of <a href=\"/boxer/3015-13\" data-ref-id=\"3015-13\">boxing</a>, its gameplay is relatively simplistic compared to modern boxing simulation games. It is comprised strictly of reflex-based timing challenges with light puzzle-solving elements. Each bout consists of three rounds lasting three \"minutes\" each; however, time elapses faster than normal on the in-game clock. Little Mac, the <a href=\"/player-character/3015-968\" data-ref-id=\"3015-968\">player character</a>, is always positioned towards the screen's lower half during a bout. Mac's sprite is usually drawn facing away from the screen and towards his opponent, who occupies the upper half of the screen area.</p><p style=\"\">Pressing the controller's B button throws a left body blow and A throws a right body blow. Holding Up on the D-pad while pressing B or A throws a left or right <a href=\"/jab/3015-2078\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2078\">jab</a> toward an opponent's face. Left and Right on the D-pad allow the player to <a href=\"/dodge/3015-2476\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">dodge</a> incoming attacks, and holding Down can <a href=\"/blocking/3015-1843\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1843\">block</a> most standard punches. Players can also <a href=\"/crouching/3015-378\" data-ref-id=\"3015-378\">duck</a> under attacks by rapidly pressing Down twice.</p><p style=\"\">Due to Little Mac's short stature, players must use a measure of strategy to defeat his relatively-gigantic opponents. These rival boxers perform one of several distinctive gestures (commonly referred to as \"tells\") before throwing certain types of punches. After dodging or blocking an opponent's attack, the player can often respond with one or more <a href=\"/counter-system/3015-867\" data-ref-id=\"3015-867\">counter-punches</a>. As Little Mac's opponents become more difficult, progress usually hinges not only on raw reflexes, but also the player's ability to recognize an opponent's tells and deliver effective counter-punches. There are some instances in which Mac can safely execute an opening attack, either to successfully land blows or to provoke an opponent into performing a counter-attack that will leave him vulnerable.</p><p style=\"\"><a href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">Stamina meters</a> for Little Mac and his opponent are displayed at the top of the screen. Stamina is consumed each time a boxer is hit successfully by their opponent. When a boxer's stamina meter is depleted, they are knocked down onto the mat and must try to get up before referee <a href=\"/mario/3005-177\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a> can perform a ten count and declare a <a href=\"/knock-out/3015-313\" data-ref-id=\"3015-313\">knock-out</a>. If Little Mac is knocked down, the player can attempt to recover by <a href=\"/button-mashing/3015-44\" data-ref-id=\"3015-44\">button mashing</a> the controller's A and B buttons; however, Mac can only get back up a handful of times per match before he becomes totally exhausted. Once per bout, players can press the Select button between rounds to recover some extra stamina. Additionally, any boxer who falls three times in a single round is considered defeated by TKO, or \"technical knock-out\". If neither boxer has been knocked-out by the end of the third round, Mario will declare a decision winner based upon the player's total <a href=\"/high-score/3015-260\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">point score</a>, although some opponents cannot be defeated by Mac in this manner.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9791/369194-34.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-369194\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9791/369194-34.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-369194\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9791/369194-34.png\"></a><figcaption>The final \"Dream Bout\" featuring Mike Tyson</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Little Mac's <a href=\"/fatigue/3015-5975\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5975\">fatigue</a> is represented by a <a href=\"/heart/3055-142\" data-ref-id=\"3055-142\">Heart</a> counter in the upper-left. Each match begins with a set number of Hearts; bouts against opponents that require extensive blocking will usually start with a greater number of Hearts for Mac. Each time the player's attack is blocked by an opponent, or Little Mac takes a punch from his opponent (whether blocked or unblocked), Mac will lose Hearts. When Mac's Hearts reach zero, he becomes fatigued and must spend a few seconds recovering before he is able to attack again.</p><p style=\"\">If the player hits their opponent at certain critical moments (typically just before they throw a strong punch), Little Mac earns a <a href=\"/star/3055-1818\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1818\">Star</a>. The player can hold up to three Stars at a time, which allow Little Mac to execute a slow but very strong <a href=\"/uppercut/3015-1128\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1128\">uppercut</a> by pressing the Start button. If Little Mac's uppercut successfully connects, it deals a large amount of stamina damage to his opponent; in some cases this may even knock a boxer down onto the mat with a single punch. Mac will lose one Star if he is punched by his opponent, and he loses all his Stars if he is knocked down.</p><h2>The Circuits</h2><p style=\"\">Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! consists of three circuits as well as the final \"Dream Bout\" against <a href=\"/mike-tyson/3005-170\" data-ref-id=\"3005-170\">Mike Tyson</a>. Each opponent is more difficult than the last; any boxers who Little Mac faces in a later rematch become significantly more difficult to defeat compared to their first encounter.</p><h3>Minor Circuit</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1692738-glassjoe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1692738\" data-ratio=\"1.088\" data-width=\"125\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 125px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/1692738-glassjoe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1692738\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/103881/1692738-glassjoe.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/103881/1692738-glassjoe.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><strong><a href=\"/glass-joe/3005-278\" data-ref-id=\"3005-278\">Glass Joe</a></strong> is the series' infamous pushover, allowing Little Mac to initiate most of the contact both to the head and to the body at the outset of the fight.

Ed Semrad wrote, \"This has got to be one of the best fighting games next to Street Fighter 2, (and in some cases better than SF2). The voices are crisp and clear, plus the control is absolutely wonderful! Another factor that I truly like is the story mode set up with dialog boxes unraveling the whole plot! There are plenty of combos that will get you going! Another great hit from the pros at Konami\".</p>",

In it, Ki is sent by Ishtar to the tower to get back her (Ishtar's) stolen Blue Crystal Rod, leading to her capture by Druaga and subsequent rescue by Gilgamesh. It is one of the many spin-off games and products that reflect the huge popularity the Druaga series had in Japan in that era. The game also amusingly includes many D&amp;D monsters, from well-known creatures like beholders to obscure entries like the Axbeak and Rust Monster. Kai must navigate 60 floors to end the story; however, there are 40 bonus floors afterwards which are unconnected to the story. These bonus stages include cameos by the ghosts from Pac-man and enemies from Dig Dug!<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1691935-screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691935\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.72463768115942\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1691935-screenshot.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691935\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1691935-screenshot.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Look out for that anemone.</figcaption></figure>     The player must navigate Ki, who is largely defenseless barring a couple of item pick-ups to be mentioned later, through each stage in as quick a manner as possible; the door which marks the end can only be opened with a key generally located elsewhere in the stage. If the timer runs out the player loses a life; making contact with an enemy, trap, or projectile will also cause Ki to lose a life. Should Ki make contact with an enemy, that enemy will disappear on the next attempt in the stage. Being hit by an enemy's spell will not make them disappear.<br /> <br />However, while Ki may be incapable of offense, she has all sorts of tricky movements at her disposal. Ishtar has granted Ki a magical tiara which gives her a form of flight; holding down the jump button will cause Ki to rise so long as the button is held down, and letting go causes her to begin to fall slowly. Be careful not to bump Ki's head on the ceiling, or she'll hurt it and fall to the ground with potentially fatal consequences should an enemy be waiting. Should the player get a game over, they can choose to begin the game again anew or continue from the stage they last died on.<br /> <br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1691933-beholder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691933\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.76923076923077\" data-width=\"195\" style=\"width: 195px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1691933-beholder.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1691933\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1691933-beholder.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1691933-beholder.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A beholder. </figcaption></figure>    <br /> <br />In each stage are a variety of chests that contain items that can assist Ki... or hinder her if it's a trap.

It was only released in Japan on July 31, 1989 for the Famicom. The game was developed and published by <a href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco</a>. Unlike the first <a href=\"/splatterhouse/3030-15148\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15148\">Splatterhouse</a>, Wanpaku Graffiti had \"super-deformed\" characters, probably due to the hardware of the Famicom. The game is a prequel to Splatterhouse. In Wanpaku Graffiti, the player takes on the role of Rick as he hunts the evil Pumpkin King though seven levels of gameplay.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16770/849973-37_game_27.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-849973\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 254px\" data-ratio=\"0.8740157480315\" data-width=\"254\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/16770/849973-37_game_27.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-849973\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/16770/849973-37_game_27.gif\"></a><figcaption>Despite the game's cuter style, there is a lot of gore.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Wanpaku Graffiti is a beat-'em-up, just like the other games in the Splatterhouse franchise. Despite the game's \"cuter\" tone, there is still gore (as with other games in the franchise). Rick fights his way through seven levels, filled with a variety of enemies. Wanpaku Graffiti also has a level system. The higher the level, the larger the life bar is. Wanpaku Graffiti also contains numerous references to horror movies such as Alien, The Exorcist, Jaws, and Friday the 13th.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Bubble Bobble is an <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade </a>game created by <a href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135\" data-ref-id=\"3010-135\">Taito</a>. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-op </a>platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.</p><p style=\"\">It was one of the first games to feature two-player <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">cooperative play</a> and <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">multiple endings</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/220785-1039261395_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220785\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/220785-1039261395_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220785\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/220785-1039261395_00.gif\"></a><figcaption>An early level</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Bubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.</p><p style=\"\">There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/221513-1058390306_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221513\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/221513-1058390306_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-221513\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/221513-1058390306_00.gif\"></a><figcaption>A level shaped like a character</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">whales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.</p><h2>Powerups</h2><p style=\"\">There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level.

If Snakey is killed, and something is blocking his spawn, he will respawn elsewhere.</p><h3>Gol</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258002-gol.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258002\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 272px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258002-gol.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258002\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258002-gol.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258002-gol.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gol</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gol sits as a neutral character until all the heart framers in a level have been collected. After this, Gol becomes hostile and works very similarly to a Medusa. The only difference between Gol and Medusa at this point is that Medusa's projectiles can not be dodged, but Gol's fireballs are avoidable.</p><h3>Leeper</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258013-leeper.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258013\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 272px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258013-leeper.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258013\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258013-leeper.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258013-leeper.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Leeper</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">An enemy that hops around and falls asleep when he touches Lolo. Leepers are mostly harmless enemies, but their main goal is to trap Lolo into an area that he'll be unable to escape. Leepers are incapable of crossing grass areas. Lolo can cleverly use Leeper's falling asleep ability to place him in front of other enemies, blocking them.</p><h3>Skull</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258018-skull.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258018\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258018-skull.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258018\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258018-skull.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258018-skull.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Skull</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Similarly to Gol, Skulls wake up after Lolo collects all of the heart framers in the level. Skulls do not move directly towards Lolo, but are rather like the ghosts in Pac-Man:  slowly making their way towards their prey. If they do manage to run into Lolo, he dies instantly.</p><h3>Rocky</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258017-rocky.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258017\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 272px\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"272\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3945/258017-rocky.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-258017\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258017-rocky.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3945/258017-rocky.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rocky</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">An enemy that, like Leeper, tries to trap Lolo; however, unlike Leeper, he will continue to chase the player if they evade his trap.

      "deck": "Bump 'N' Jump involves high speed car crashes and plenty of obstacles to jump over.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Bump 'N' Jump started as an arcade game developed by Data East, which was licensed to Bally Midway for its use in 1982. Its popularity spawned several console ports, the last being an NES version in 1988.<br /><br />In Bump 'N' Jump, players drive a red car down an open road at up to 220 MPH (or km/h in some versions). The main objective is to reach the gas station at the end of each roadway without crashing into obstacles, trees, or water. The road is filled with traffic of both light and heavy cars and trucks, some of which attempt to take the player's car out by bumping into it and sending it skidding to the side. Points are earned for progress made down the road, as well as bumping into other cars and sending them skidding off the road or into obstacles.<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/347/330514-bumpnjump_warning.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-330514\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7152209492635\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/347/330514-bumpnjump_warning.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-330514\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/347/330514-bumpnjump_warning.png\"></a><figcaption>A warning sign to jump. Jump!</figcaption></figure> Once the player's car reaches 100 MPH, the car can jump high into the air. Around 40-50 MPH in speed will be lost by a single jump, so players will need to use some strategy to decide when it is most advantageous to utilize jumping. Jumping can come in handy to avoid skidding off the road when bumped, and also for avoiding patches of heavy traffic. Landing on enemy cars will destroy them and earn points.<br /><br />Countless broken bridges, water, slight curves, and splits also pose problems along the road. Well-timed jumps are often the only way to clear some obstacles such as broken bridges, and also are the easiest way to clear most water hazards. Because timing is essential for clearing major hazards, a warning beep sounds and a \"!\" will appear at the top of the screen when a hazard requiring a jump is imminent (though some hazards may still have safe causeways on one side). Landing on islands in the middle of water or bridge hazards will earn bonus points.<br /><br />At the end of a roadway, the number of enemy cars taken out is added to the player's score as bonus points, usually 300 to 500 points per car. In the event no enemies were crashed during the roadway, a significantly large bonus of 50,000 points will be awarded.<br /><br />As with most retro games, the game ends once the player exhausts all their lives.<br /><br /><h2>Levels</h2>Roadways in Bump 'N' Jump are based off seasons. Once a player completes the first roadway, they start a Spring stage, then progress to a Summer stage, and so on, moving and repeating through all the seasons. The colors in these stages reflect their represented season, and offer little other change beyond increasing difficulty.<br /><br />The variation of roadways varies between versions. In the arcade version, after the first three roads, the game begins a cycle of five roadways in order, repeating indefinitely until game over. The Intellivision version claims to have 32 unique roadways, while the Atari 2600 version has only eight (perhaps in the same manner as the arcade version).<br /><br /><h2>Enemies</h2>Differentiating every type of enemy car can be difficult, especially in console versions with lower detailed graphics. For the sake of simplicity, it is best to assume that any cars not mentioned here are light, may weave back and forth on the road in a non-hostile manner, and will skid a long way if hit.<br /><br />The more important cars to watch for are listed below.<br /><br /><h3>Tractor</h3><br />The tractor is often mistaken as a tank by players, as it has large treads and a dark green appearance in some console versions. The tractor drives in a straight line, and is extremely slow and easy to pass. Bumping a heavy tractor will barely budge it, and will send the player skidding further than usual. For this reason, caution should be used when passing tractors on narrow sections of road.<br /><br /><h3>Skull Car</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/347/330511-bumpnjump_enemies.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-330511\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/347/330511-bumpnjump_enemies.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-330511\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/347/330511-bumpnjump_enemies.png\"></a><figcaption>One skull car and two dump trucks.</figcaption></figure><br />The skull car is obvious in appearance, as it has a large skull and crossbones on its roof. When the players gets near a skull car, it will usually move toward the player, attempting to bump them off the road and generally get in the way. While this is far more dangerous in writing than in practice, poorly-timed encounters with a skull car can cause bumping that slows a player down at a crucial moment, ruining a necessary jump. The same warning applies to narrow roads and splits, especially when trying to navigate around other vehicles.<br /><br /><h3>Dump Truck</h3><br />Arguably the most dangerous enemy in the game, the dump truck often moves faster than the player's top speed, and will dump out piles of debris that can crash the player if hit. Dump trucks only move in a straight line, and often must be watched closely while engaging other traffic. Simply touching a dump truck will destroy it -- an important fact to keep in mind if shooting for the 50,000 point no-kill bonus.<br /><br />During the first roadway, and select seasons afterwards (depending on version), the dump truck will make its dumping animation, but won't actually dump any debris onto the road.<br /><br /><h3>White Car</h3><br />The white car is not as aggressive as the skull car, but will move towards the player and attempt to interfere upon approach. As with the skull car, care must be taken to avoid letting the white car botch jump speed and timing.<br /><br /><h3>Yellow Truck</h3><br />In more graphically detailed versions, this truck may be blue with a yellow front. Otherwise, it looks like a pure yellow heavy-duty dump truck. The yellow truck is appropriately heavy, much like the tractor, but also weaves across the road frequently, making it tougher to simply dodge.<br /><br /><h2>Difficulty</h2>While Bump 'N' Jump is not a difficult game to learn by any means, its difficulty varies from system to system. Successfully completing roadways often necessitates rote memorization, as the top-down view makes knowledge of upcoming splits and twists in hazards impossible. This is especially true in later stages, where the player may be required to time landings on small islands in the middle of hazards before jumping again, without knowing what speed is necessary to hit the island.<br /><br />Some versions of the game are also stingy in handing out lives. The Intellivision version only explicitly promises one extra life at 20,000 points, and makes no mention of other opportunities for extra lives. In the arcade and Atari 2600 versions, where extra lives are awarded every 30,000 points, the best way to maintain a healthy supply of lives is by earning the 50,000 no-kill bonus as often as possible.<br /><br /><h2>NES version</h2>The NES version of Bump 'N' Jump came out in 1988, far later than earlier versions, and exhibits significant differences over its predecessors in both difficulty and storyline.<br /><br />A plot is added in which the protagonist's girlfriend has been kidnapped by generic thugs, who he pursues over 16 stages. The seasons concept is thrown out for a more diversely themed set of stages, featuring cityscapes, beaches, and cliffsides. Some stages also contain bonus air targets, which can be hit at the peak of a jump.<br /><br />The difficulty for this version is also much higher, with only three lives available to start and very high score thresholds to attain extra lives. In addition, P-fuel cells need to be gathered along the road, in order to keep a rapidly-depleting fuel tank full. Running out of fuel costs a life, which makes the process of surviving all the more bothersome. A few recharge stations can be entered in certain stages throughout the game, which starts a lengthy button mashing bonus sequence to regain P-fuel.<br /><br />Upon reaching the end of stage 16, the player engages in a boss fight with the enemy car carrying his girlfriend. Running out of P-fuel here does not kill the player, but renders them unable to jump regardless of speed. After the boss is jumped on enough times and destroyed, a cutscene plays, and the 16 stages begin all over again.",

Designer <a href=\"/tomohiro-nishikado/3040-55262\" data-ref-id=\"3040-55262\">Tomohiro Nishikado</a> was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/gun-fight/3030-32574\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32574\">Gun Fight</a>, <a href=\"/breakout/3030-13049\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout</a>, The War of the Worlds, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/star-wars/3025-551\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a>. The game’s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the <a href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">golden age of arcade video games</a> (circa 1978-1984).</p><p style=\"\">Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around <a href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">$3.8 billion</a> in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2707975-34246.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2707975\" data-ratio=\"1.1612903225806\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:116.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/13/139866/2707975-34246.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2707975\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/139866/2707975-34246.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Gameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small <a href=\"/spaceship/3055-17\" data-ref-id=\"3055-17\">ship</a> that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven <a href=\"/aliens/3015-186\" data-ref-id=\"3015-186\">aliens</a> each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player’s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their “invasion.” As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue <a href=\"/never-ending/3015-1467\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1467\">indefinitely</a>).</p><p style=\"\">The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or “bunkers” near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a “mystery ship” will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.</p><h2>Development</h2><p style=\"\">While working for the <a href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135\" data-ref-id=\"3010-135\">Taito Corporation</a>, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game <a href=\"/breakout/3030-13049\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout</a>. The game was planned to have <a href=\"/tank/3055-92\" data-ref-id=\"3055-92\">tanks</a>, <a href=\"/airplane/3055-910\" data-ref-id=\"3055-910\">planes</a>, and <a href=\"/battleship/3055-1252\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1252\">battleships</a> as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies <a href=\"/human/3015-810\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">human</a> (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film <em>Star Wars</em>, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of <em>The War of the Worlds</em>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3411/2292360-spaceinvaders_cabinet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292360\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5321428571429\" data-width=\"280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3411/2292360-spaceinvaders_cabinet.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2292360\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3411/2292360-spaceinvaders_cabinet.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Upright cabinet</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese</a> and <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">American</a> components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated <a href=\"/fujitsu/3010-6596\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6596\">Fujitsu</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_display_controller#List_of_example_VDCs\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">MB14241</a> video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of <a href=\"/sprite/3015-491\" data-ref-id=\"3015-491\">sprite</a> graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a <a href=\"/texas-instruments/3010-2025\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2025\">Texas Instruments</a> SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the <a href=\"http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=629\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Taito 8080</a> arcade system board.</p><p style=\"\">In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.</p><p style=\"\">It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail <a href=\"/arcade-cabinet/3055-1232\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1232\">cabinet</a>, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder <a href=\"/midway-games/3010-185\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Bally/Midway</a> then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game’s original title, Space Monsters.</p><h2>Impact and Legacy</h2><p style=\"\">Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins—and subsequent production increase—in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then <a title=\"List of highest-grossing films\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\" rel=\"nofollow\">highest-grossing film</a> <em><a title=\"Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/star-wars/3025-551\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a></em>, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/623836-space_invaders__1980___atari__9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-623836\" data-ratio=\"0.65625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/623836-space_invaders__1980___atari__9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-623836\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/623836-space_invaders__1980___atari__9.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/623836-space_invaders__1980___atari__9.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Atari 2600 version</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The 1980 Atari <a href=\"/atari-2600/3045-40\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">2600</a> version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first \"<a title=\"Killer app\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_app\" rel=\"nofollow\">killer app</a>\" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges.

Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.</p><p style=\"\">Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by <a title=\"Pong\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pong/3025-1724\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1724\">Pong</a> clones flooding the market, and beginning the <a title=\"Golden age of video arcade games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_age_of_video_arcade_games\" rel=\"nofollow\">golden age of video arcade games</a>.According to <em>The Observer</em>, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. <a title=\"1UP.com\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/1UP.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">1UP</a> stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television <a title=\"IGN\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/IGN\" rel=\"nofollow\">IGN</a> attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. <a title=\"Electronic Games (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Electronic_Games?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electronic Games</a> credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as \"the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time.\" <a title=\"Game Informer\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Game_Informer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Game Informer</a> considered it, along with <a title=\"Pac-Man\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pac-man/3030-7624\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man</a>, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the \"Top 10 Most Influential Games\" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of \"The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,\" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which \"were attempts to <a title=\"Simulation video game (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Simulation_video_game?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">simulate</a> already-existing things,\" Space Invaders was \"the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else.\" In 2008, <a title=\"Guinness World Records (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Guinness_World_Records?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guinness World Records</a> listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.</p><p style=\"\">As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a <a title=\"Score (game)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/high-score/3015-260\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high score</a>, being the first to <a title=\"Saved game (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Saved_game?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">save</a> the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple <a title=\"Health (gaming) (page does not exist)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/lives/3015-323\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a>, had to repel hordes of enemies, could <a title=\"Cover system (page does not exist)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cover-system/3015-55\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">take cover</a> from enemy fire, and use <a title=\"Destructible environment (page does not exist)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/destructible-environment/3015-243\" data-ref-id=\"3015-243\">destructible</a> barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous <a title=\"Video game music (page does not exist)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dynamic-soundtrack/3015-1319\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1319\">background soundtrack</a>, with four simple <a title=\"Diatonic and chromatic (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Diatonic_and_chromatic?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">diatonic</a> descending <a title=\"Bass note (page does not exist)\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Bass_note?action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">bass notes</a> repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.</p><p style=\"\">It also introduced the concept of a <a title=\"Dynamic game difficulty balancing (page does not exist)\" href=\"/difficulty-level/3015-183\" data-ref-id=\"3015-183\">difficulty curve</a>, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern <a title=\"Single-player\" href=\"/single-player-only/3015-6130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6130\">single-player</a> video gaming.</p><p style=\"\">Cited by influential creators like <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and <a href=\"/hideo-kojima/3040-63395\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima</a> as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of <a href=\"/pong/3030-22195\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22195\">Pong</a> clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like <a href=\"/rca/3010-7515\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7515\">RCA</a> and <a href=\"/fairchild-semiconductor/3010-2362\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2362\">Fairchild</a>). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a “<a href=\"/high-score/3015-260\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high score</a>,” and was the first to save the player’s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple <a href=\"/lives/3015-323\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a> and provide <a href=\"/destructible-cover/3015-112\" data-ref-id=\"3015-112\">destructible cover</a> against enemy fire.

Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant <a title=\"Video game genres\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Video_game_genres\" rel=\"nofollow\">genre</a> on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a \"seminal arcade classic\", IGN listed it as the number eight \"classic shoot 'em up\". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/atari/3010-182\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari</a>'s <a title=\"Asteroids\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/asteroids/3025-40\" data-ref-id=\"3025-40\">Asteroids</a>, <a title=\"Williams Electronics\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/williams-electronic-games-inc/3010-3243\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3243\">Williams Electronic</a>'s <a title=\"Defender (video game)\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/defender/3025-140\" data-ref-id=\"3025-140\">Defender</a>, and <a title=\"Namco\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/namco/3010-7420\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco</a>'s <a title=\"Galaxian\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/galaxian/3025-225\" data-ref-id=\"3025-225\">Galaxian</a> and <a title=\"Galaga\" href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/galaga/3030-15784\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15784\">Galaga</a>, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design.

There are five levels in the game, each with a boss at the end.</p><p style=\"\">The game features power-ups but only one may be carried. Jackie can also charge a special beam-like attack on his elbow by holding the B button and releasing it. This attack may be done five times. Most enemies Jackie defeats will drop green orbs. Collecting 30 of these orbs will replenish his life and his 5 charged shots.</p><p style=\"\">If the player dies, all orbs and power-ups are lost and must be gained again. The player only has 1 life in the game, but may continue up to five times initially. Extra continues may be earned through the bonus stages, these are levels triggered by bells in the levels which transport Jackie to the bonus stage.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When the TurboGrafx-16 version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,7,7,4 adding, \"...Once you get used to the unusual looks of the characters and get involved in the game, you will find a well designed cart with a lot of game play built in.

His goal is to reach the end of each stage, traversing hazards and defeating enemies with his Mega Blaster (the default weapon, renamed Mega Buster in <a href=\"/mega-man-4/3030-8141\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8141\">Mega Man 4</a>). The end boss of each stage is called a Robot Master, of which there are six.</p><p style=\"\">Each of Dr. Wily's six reprogrammed robots, or <a href=\"/robot-masters/3015-154\" data-ref-id=\"3015-154\">Robot Masters</a>, must be fought at the end of their own individual stages before the player can enter Wily's fortress. The player can tackle the stages in any order, and once a Robot Master is defeated, Mega Man will acquire a new weapon. Every weapon has its own energy meter (except the default Mega Blaster), which can individually be filled or depleted based on usage. Each of the Robot Masters is especially weak against a certain weapon used by a different Robot Master, giving the player a reason to tackle the stages in a specific order.</p><p style=\"\">Each of the weapons have their unique abilities. One weapon for example (Guts Man's weapon) gives Mega Man the ability to pick up large blocks and toss them at enemies.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><p style=\"\"><b>DRN-003:</b> <a href=\"/cut-man/3005-894/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-894\">Cut Man</a></p><p style=\"\"><i>\"Designed to function as a lumberjack.

      "description": "<h2>Summary</h2><p style=\"\">Mario is Missing is one of Nintendo's many entries into the \"edutainment\" genre, and one of the few Nintendo games to feature the Mario brother Luigi as the main playable character.</p><p style=\"\">Mario is Missing is a unique Mario game in that the action does not occur in the Mushroom Kingdom, but rather on terrestrial Earth, set in a time contemporary to the game's release date. The visual style of the game is borrowed its SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font to the overworld city maps.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215417\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215417\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/215417-1109440421_01.png\"></a><figcaption>Even the greats have bad days.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.</p><p style=\"\">While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather additional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215418\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-215418\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/215418-1109561316_00.png\"></a><figcaption>Save the world, or keep the flute. Hmm...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Players also have access to an overworld map, showing the street connections, as well as Koopa and warp pipe locations. Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.</p><p style=\"\">A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.</p><p style=\"\">Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.</p><p style=\"\">Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece.</p>",

The game features many memorable foes, such as the Wraith the player encounters early in the game and the fire-breathing Dragon later down the line.</p><p style=\"\">Death is a very, very common thing in Shadowgate. If the player died at a point they can retrace their steps and attempt to solve the puzzle differently, and if they succeed they can proceed, but would only progress so far before being smote again and retracing their steps once more. The game is as much about thinking intelligently about solutions as it is just running in and trying everything one at a time until the correct method is used. There are a few instances where there are multiple solutions to a given problem, but these are few and far between.</p><p style=\"\">Shadowgate has many items that are used to solve puzzles in the game. Some of the items that appear to be normal are used in ways most people would never think of. Such as the <a href=\"/war-hammer/3055-729\" data-ref-id=\"3055-729\">war hammer</a> that the player can't actually use to attack any enemies but is used to open secret portals. Some items, like the <a href=\"/helmet/3055-737\" data-ref-id=\"3055-737\">helmet</a> or human <a href=\"/bone/3055-1482\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1482\">bone</a>, can be picked up but have no use whatsoever in the game except to clutter the inventory. Most items only have one use and are never used again. There are only a few items that can be used more than once, but even then the most they are used is twice. There are around 40 items in the game that all need to be used to solve a specific puzzle. Usually there is no <a href=\"/tips/3015-1607\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1607\">hints</a> when to use an item, which leads to a lot of guessing and <a href=\"/trial-and-error/3015-1850\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1850\">trial and error</a> to discover when each item needs to be used.</p><h2>Remake</h2><p style=\"\">Initially intended to be a 25th anniversary celebration, a <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/shadowgate/3030-43403\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43403\">remake</a> was confirmed to be in production for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a>, <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a>, and <a href=\"/android/3045-123\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> for release in 2013. Footage, art direction, and remixed music have been shown off at the game's <a href=\"/kickstarter-funded/3015-7378\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7378\">Kickstarter</a>. Some puzzles are new or reworked, and all of the components, including graphics and script, are being completely overhauled.

In the game, the player has to solve 5 cases by collecting clues and interrogating suspects, working his way through the underworld before zeroing in on the city crime kingpin <i>Alphonse \"Big Boy\" Caprice.</i></p><h3>Driving</h3><p style=\"\">Using his well-recognized yellow car to get across the city's grid-like map, Tracy dodges rooftop snipers and mad drivers in an effort to find the next clue. The driving portion of this game has a noticeable likeness to the original Grand Theft Auto series and could be quite frustrating to drive from point A to point B due to the lack of differences between one part of the city to the next as well as the constant sniper fire that is nearly unavoidable. Your car could stop on a dime and turn, with an annoying screeching sound, for easier navigation of the roads or to avoid the other reckless drivers on the road that will damage you if you touch them; nevermind that this game has one of the worst driving mechanisms to ever see the light of day - you are doomed before you even get to the first crime scene.</p><h3>On Foot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8430/930790-clue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-930790\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74782608695652\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8430/930790-clue.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-930790\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8430/930790-clue.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A clue.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Tracy was able to get on foot during the driving portion. This was useful mostly to:</p><p style=\"\">A.) Shoot rooftop snipers</p><p style=\"\">B.) Enter buildings.</p><p style=\"\">After entering a building, Tracy punches, shoots, jumps and dodges his way to the coveted clue or suspect. This was done in a side-scrolling view. Punching enemies was really interesting because it would cause enemies to kneel down and spin around endlessly on the map until they finally spun off of the screen. Shooting enemies was annoying because the game forced you to be a good cop. You were not allowed to shoot unarmed men or you would lose health. This was great in theory but terrible in practice because more often than not you would go to shoot an armed enemy and an unarmed enemy would somehow find their way into your line of fire.</p><h3>Cases</h3><p style=\"\">The game consists of 5 cases. To solve a case, Tracy has to collect all 5 clues in the case, and then find and arrest the person they point to. The cases are:</p><ol><li><u>The Bogus Bucks</u> - Track down the source of a fake $20 bill.</li><li><u>Torchsong Tale</u> - Prove Lips Manlis burned down the nightclub.</li><li><u>A Bang Up Job</u> - Find who sent Det. Sam Catchem a mail bomb.</li><li><u>The Kidnap Caper</u> - Find the person who kidnapped the diplomat.</li><li><u>Banks Alot</u> - Track down the bankrobbers.</li></ol><h3>Game Over</h3><p style=\"\">The game gave you no extra lives so when you died it was for good - no continues. This game does have a locked safe at the title screen that acts as a password system via a three-digit code. Dick Tracy is notorious for its unforgiving difficulty via seemingly cheap mechanics that work solely against the player with no real counter to the problems it presents.</p>",

To reach the dragon castle on each of 6 maps, the player has to make his way through different locations, more or less free to chose his route. At the start of each map, the player is presented with a screen that shows which useful items can each type of locations contain. Upon entering a location (using the 'SELECT' button) the view changes to an overhead camera.</p><p style=\"\">The player then has two tasks: find a key dropped by monsters and locate an exit (sometimes dropped by monsters too, leading to some levels having multiple exits). Finished locations disappear from the game map, freeing the way for the hero. The game also uses password system.</p><p style=\"\">Unlike the original game, in Dragon Buster II the protagonist can't use any forms of magic, having only his bow to dispose of enemies, most of which usually take about two shots. The game also features interesting mechanics of showing player's hit points - when Carl is damaged, his shirt color gradually changes (blue -&gt; green -&gt; yellow -&gt; red). Health is replenished via special healing pools and power-ups (fairies). It is also replenished at the start of each location.</p><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-611\" href=\"/world-map/3015-611\">world map</a> is comprised of several \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-1181\" href=\"/instance/3015-1181\">instance</a>\" dungeons with semi-randomized layouts that the player must find the most efficient path through - once complete, the dungeon vanishes from the map and the player can progress towards the goal.</p><h2><b>Trivia</b></h2><p style=\"\">An interesting mechanic of arrows <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3335\" href=\"/ricochet/3055-3335\">ricocheting</a> off the walls can result in the hero actually shooting himself with a bow.</p><p style=\"\">The game has a few similarities to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" href=\"/intellivision/3045-51\">Intellivision</a> game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17516\" href=\"/advanced-dungeons-dragons-cartridge/3030-17516\">Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> (sometimes known as AD&amp;D: Cloudy Mountain, which in turn is based somewhat on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13729\" href=\"/hunt-the-wumpus/3030-13729\">Hunt the Wumpus</a>), which also featured a lone hero stalking around a dark maze that lights up with further exploration, using the sounds of distant monsters to figure out where they were lurking.</p>",

The player walks across the bottom of the screen shooting a grappling-gun upwards at bubbles that bounce around the screen in various ways.

Firing the gun causes a hook with a wire attached to fly upwards. Bubbles can be popped by hitting them with the hook, or if they bounce into the wire. When larger bubbles are hit, they split into two smaller bubbles. They continue to split until they reach their smallest size, at which point a shot will destroy them. The player can collect powerups, such as a faster gun or the ability to have two hooks on-screen, or pop bubbles with a clock icon to stop time for several seconds. There are two modes of play, but both share the same gameplay.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h3>Arcade Mode</h3><p style=\"\">In Arcade mode, the player travels through pre-made stages set in locations across the world.

The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.</p><p style=\"\">The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"/bits-studios-ltd/3010-2102\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2102\">Bits Studios</a> release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like <a href=\"/vigilante/3030-4146\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4146\">Vigilante</a>) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.</li><li>The <a href=\"/teeny-weeny-games-ltd/3010-2463\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2463\">Teeny Weeny Games</a> release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like <a href=\"/double-dragon/3030-20752\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20752\">Double Dragon</a>. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.</li><li>The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.</li></ul><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as \"one of the worst SNES games ever made.\" A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on <a href=\"http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/lastactionhero/lastactionhero.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Hardcore Gaming 101</a>.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Jurassic Park is an action game released on multiple systems to tie-in with the movie of the same name. In each version of the game the player takes on the role of Dr Alan Grant and follows the events of the movie (and the book it is based on).</p><p style=\"\">There are numerous differences between the various versions. The titles on Nintendo's platforms were handled by Ocean Software while Sega's titles were developed by BlueSky Software.</p><p style=\"\">The 1993 Sega CD version, which is an a point and click adventure game rather than an action game, has a separate page <a href=\"/jurassic-park/3030-21383\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21383\">here</a>.</p><h2>Genesis Version</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4187/223489-jurassicpark04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223489\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.72727272727273\" data-width=\"319\" style=\"width: 319px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4187/223489-jurassicpark04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223489\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4187/223489-jurassicpark04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A Tyrannosaurus breaks through the wall of the power plant.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">BlueSky's Genesis title is a 2D platformer which allowed the player to play as either Dr. Grant or a Velociraptor while they attempted to escape Isla Nublar. Since the game began development before the film had been completed the designers had to borrow heavily from the novel for stages. With additions like the pump station and river levels being ripped directly from the novel.</p><p style=\"\">Gameplay when selecting Dr. Grant is a standard side-scrolling action platformer. As he attempts to escape the island he amasses an arsenal of non-lethal weapons such as darts, smoke grenades, and tasers. This character's series of levels leads him through locales such as a power plant, a river (where he pilots a motorboat), and the interior of an active volcano. Grant's finale sees him reaching the visitor's center and escaping the island via helicopter.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4187/225290-jurassicpark05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225290\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.69953051643192\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4187/225290-jurassicpark05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225290\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4187/225290-jurassicpark05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The hunt continues.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Opting to play as the Velociraptor gives the player access to a completely different arsenal, namely the raptor's claws. The raptor's main goals are to eventually defeat Dr. Grant and reach the mainland. Playing through each level will require the raptor to defeat armed guards still stationed on the island as well as other hostile dinosaurs. The raptor's campaign is noticeably shorter than Grant's, completely skipping levels such as the volcano and river. Completing the game as the raptor shows that it successfully escaped the island by concealing itself in a crate that is loaded into a cargo ship.</p><p style=\"\">After the successful sales of the Genesis version BlueSky released a sequel to Jurassic Park, <a href=\"/jurassic-park-rampage-edition/3030-21293\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21293\">Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition</a>. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game were similar to the Genesis version, but developed by Sega separately in Japan and didn't feature the raptor protagonist.</p><h2>SNES Version</h2><p style=\"\">The SNES version of Jurassic Park is incredibly different from its Genesis counterpart. In the game the player controls Grant from a top down perspective and is given the task of collecting a number of velociraptor eggs before they hatch. Along with a much more cartoony and brighter look, it also has first-person indoor sections in the same vein as Doom where Grant has to collect key cards and codes for use outside.</p><p style=\"\">For the most part, the game is very open-ended, not unlike some earlier Zelda games. The game requires Grant to do a lot of backtracking and hunting for items which helps progress the player through the story. Unfortunately the game has no save or password function so the player would have to collect all of the eggs in one sitting, a very daunting task with lots of trial-and-error gameplay involved.</p><h2>Game Gear Version</h2><p style=\"\">The Game Gear version has more in common with the Genesis version, being a side-scrolling shooter. With the only weapon being a pistol, the player once again assumes the role of Dr. Grant. Progression from level to level is non-linear, giving the player the option to choose which area of the island they want to tackle first. Before the actual side-scrolling segments of each zone the player would play through a vehicle segment. In these segments the player would shoot down dinosaurs pursuing the jeep, successfully clearing these levels granted bonuses. Each level is unique in its design, showcasing a different area of the island, complete with a boss fight at the end. Clearing all the selectable levels opened the Visitor Center finale, where Grant would be confronted by the park's Tyrannosaurus.</p><h2>Game Boy &amp; NES Versions</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/736833-1188050444_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736833\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.9\" data-width=\"160\" style=\"width: 160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:90.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/736833-1188050444_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-736833\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/736833-1188050444_00.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/736833-1188050444_00.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The NES and Game Boy versions were basically the same game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Like the SNES Jurassic Park, the Game Boy and NES versions were also developed by Ocean Software. Also similar to the SNES version, the main goal of each stage is to simply collect a certain number of dinosaur eggs, opening access to the next area. Blocking progress through these stages is an assortment of dinosaurs, including main enemies like velociraptors, procompsognathus, and dilophosaurus. To deal with these threats, the player is given one primary weapon, bearing a strong resemblance to a rocket launcher. As Grant kills dinosaurs they drop ammunition for his armament. Interspersed between levels are boss encounters, including a sequence where the player is required to dodge stampeding triceratops, as well as a fight where Grant does battle with a Tyrannosaurus.</p>",

The player takes control over a young Saxon man (either Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wolfric the Wild) wishing to become the King of England after the previous King (King Richard) is murdered by a Norman traitor, and the crown has been stolen. After being recruited by Robin Hood to fight for the good of the country, the player starts out with only one castle and ten soldiers and must build up his force to take back the crown and avenge the king's death by fighting against several Norman factions.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The main gameplay revolves around a Risk-style board of England in which players defend their territories from the Norman Factions, and partake in ruthless conquest in a bid to take over their territories. Amassing larger bands of troops increases the players chances of success. Many territories contain enemy castles. Upon launching an attack on a castled territory, the player must lay siege to the enemy castle by firing boulders at the castle wall from a catapult. The player can also decide to raid enemy castles for loot, which he can then use to strengthen his forces.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to this primary gameplay, several side-missions exist, including:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/313585-dotc_ami_26.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313585\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/313585-dotc_ami_26.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313585\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2238/313585-dotc_ami_26.gif\"></a><figcaption>A Jousting Match.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Rescuing captured princesses</b>: The player will occasionally receive a message from a damsel in distress, asking to be rescued from an enemy castle. The player must raid the enemy castle, sword-fighting towards the princess at the top of the castle. Upon the successful rescue of the princess, the player's character will marry the princess. There is a brief scene in which the shadowy figures of the character and the princess are seen seductively approaching each other, and their shadows are seen passionately kissing.</li><li><b>Jousting matches</b>: Occasionally invitations to rival factions tournaments will be received, in which the character must engage their rivals in mounted jousting battles. The player must line up their lance with the centre of the opponent's shield in order to knock him off the horse. A monetary prize is granted to the winner, which can be used to benefit your military conquest. The hero can also hold his own jousting tournaments from time to time.</li></ul><h2>Ending</h2><p style=\"\">Upon successfully completing the game (by defeating all the Norman factions) it is revealed that it was in fact Robin Hood who stole the crown. He did this in order to provide the hero a platform to prove their worthiness to become the new king of England. Robin returns the crown to the hero who is crowned king, and everyone lives happily ever after.</p><h2>Platform Differences</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/313581-dotc_ami_23.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313581\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2238/313581-dotc_ami_23.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-313581\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2238/313581-dotc_ami_23.gif\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2238/313581-dotc_ami_23.gif\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Amiga Version.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Defender of the Crown was released on many different platforms.

The ports to the NES and DOS were the least graphically desirable versions of the game due to the limitations of the hardware.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/761921-1224258460_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-761921\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62545454545455\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/761921-1224258460_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-761921\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/761921-1224258460_00.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/761921-1224258460_00.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The DOS Version.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Some gameplay differences also existed. The original Amiga version was rushed due to financial constraints on the developers, so several planned features (most notably attacking options such as flaming projectiles for the catapults and disease-based attacks) were absent from the final product.

The planet has been invaded by evil outsiders known as Quad Runners. A mysterious character, known only as Mach Rider, is decided to help out the ailing planet earth by rescuing survivors of the attack and destroying the Quad Runners in his motorcycle. It is a very fast machine, equipped with machine guns that the player operates. The gameplay also requires the player to accelerate, steer, shoot and change gear.</p><p style=\"\">Mach Rider features three different game modes. In fighting course, the main mode, Mach Rider must advance across the ten different levels in the game destroying the Quad Runners and rescuing survivors, while at the same time attaining a high score. There are also obstacles scattered across the levels; if Mach Rider is destroyed he will reform himself unless the energy bar is depleted, in which case the player loses. In endurance mode, the objective is to achieve a certain distance within a time limit; enemies and obstacles slow the player down, as well as being destroyed. Solo course is pretty much a \"cruise mode\", you just ride the course with no enemies. Finally, in design mode the player designs courses and layouts to race in any of the previous game modes.</p><p style=\"\">Two versions of Mach Rider were released for Nintendo's arcade-focused Vs.

It was the first in the <em><a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/spartan-x/3025-2696\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2696\">Spartan X</a></em> series of video games.</p><p style=\"\">The game was highly influential in its time. It created a new genre of video games, the beat 'em up. Its designer <a href=\"/takashi-nishiyama/3040-21411\" data-ref-id=\"3040-21411\">Takashi Nishiyama</a> also later went on to create <a href=\"/street-fighter/3030-1235\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1235\">Street Fighter</a>, which itself went on to define the fighting game genre. In the film industry, the game was used to help promote Jackie Chan's film Wheels on Meals in Japan, and the game later inspired <span style=\"font-size:16px;\">a 1988 French film of the same name.</span></p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Enemies include the huge number of Mr X's lowest form of help - The men dressed in purple who are bent on grabbing Thomas and causing as much damage as possible (when they do grab Thomas, his only hope becomes the age old kung fu move of waggling). There are also men dressed in blue who are a great shot with the old throwing knife. Other enemies include fire breathing dragons, glowing orbs that propel some sort of bullet, poisonous moths, small snakes and even smaller kung fu dwarves.</p><p style=\"\">Each level of Mr X's dojo features a boss that Thomas must defeat with all his might if he is to proceed up the stairs taking him ever closer to the final boss.</p><p style=\"\">Floor one will have Thomas defeat a ruffian with a bat while floor two will test his might against a foe skilled in the art of boomerang throwing.</p><p style=\"\">Once Thomas has passed floor two, the bosses become more complex and a daunting task is put before him.</p><p style=\"\">Floor three pins Thomas against an angry giant while floor four forces him to battle a Magician of magical proportions.</p><p style=\"\">Once Thomas has reached the end of the fifth and final floor, he will be confronted by Mr X - the Kung Fu master.</p><h2>Alternate Titles</h2><p style=\"\">The original name of <em>Kung-Fu Master</em> is <em>Spartan X</em> in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>. It was released in <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">US</a> <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcades </a>as <em>Kung-Fu Master</em> and shortened to <em>Kung Fu</em> for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> version of the game. The <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom</a> version of the game is known as <em>Spartan X</em>, but Famicom cartridges labelled <em>Kung Fu</em> are known to exist in Japan and are assumed to be something of a rarity. <em>Kung Fu</em> was a launch title for the NES.</p><p style=\"\">On April 28, 2011, <em>Kung-Fu Master</em> was released for the <a href=\"/ipad/3045-121\" data-ref-id=\"3045-121\">Apple iPad</a>. It featured all five levels and is the same graphically as the arcade version.</p><h2>Related Films</h2><h3><em>Wheels on Meals (Spartan X)</em></h3><p style=\"\">In Japan, the game is named after <em>Spartan X</em>, the Japanese title for the 1984 <a href=\"/hong-kong/3035-1083\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1083\">Hong Kong</a> action movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087578/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\"><i>Wheels on Meals</i></a>, starring <a href=\"/jackie-chan/3040-3595\" data-ref-id=\"3040-3595\">Jackie Chan</a> as Thomas, a Chinese mobile fast food vendor in <a href=\"/barcelona/3035-2264\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2264\">Barcelona</a>, <a href=\"/spain/3035-527\" data-ref-id=\"3035-527\">Spain</a>. The plot of the game, and the climax of the film, involves storming a villain's castle to save Sylvia.</p><p style=\"\">Alongside Jackie Chan, the film <em>Wheels on Meals</em> also starred Sammo Hung and Yuen Baio in supporting roles, US martial arts champion Benny \"The Jet\" Urquidez as the villain's top henchman, and former Miss Spain, Lola Forner, as <a href=\"/potential-love-interest/3015-3857\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3857\">love interest</a> (and <a href=\"/damsel-in-distress/3015-100\" data-ref-id=\"3015-100\">damsel in distress</a>) Sylvia.</p><p style=\"\">While based on <em>Wheels on Meals</em>, the setting appears to be originally inspired by <a href=\"/bruce-lee/3005-6219\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6219\">Bruce Lee</a>'s final film, <i>Game of Death</i>, shortly before his death in 1973. Like the film, the game revolves around rescuing a <a href=\"/damsel-in-distress/3015-100\" data-ref-id=\"3015-100\">damsel in distress</a> at the top of a Chinese pagoda and fighting bad guys on each floor along the way. It was not long before the game's release that Irem decided to release it as a <a href=\"/tie-in/3015-653\" data-ref-id=\"3015-653\">tie-in</a> to <em>Wheels on Meals</em>, helping to bring more attention to the game in Japan.</p><p style=\"\">The game's environments more closely resembles <a href=\"/china/3035-343\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">Chinese </a>architecture (much like <em>Game of Death</em>) rather than the Spanish castle of <em>Wheels on Meals</em>. Sylvia in the game also looks Chinese, whereas Sylvia in Wheels in Meals was Spanish. In addition, the original <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade </a>version gives Thomas a voice more closely resembling Bruce Lee rather than the Jackie Chan character. In the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> port of the game as well as the 1988 arcade sequel <a href=\"/vigilante/3030-4146\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4146\">Vigilante</a>, the voice more closely resembles Jackie Chan.</p><h3><em>Kung-Fu Master!</em></h3><p style=\"\">The game itself went on to inspire a 1988 live-action <a href=\"/france/3035-197\" data-ref-id=\"3035-197\">French</a> film of the same name. Director <a title=\"Agnès Varda\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agn%C3%A8s_Varda\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agnès Varda</a> featured the game prominently in the film <i><a title=\"Kung-Fu Master (film)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Master_(film)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kung-Fu Master!</a> </i>It deals with a relationship between a 40 year-old woman and a 14 year-old boy obsessed with the game. The film was retitled <i>Le Petit Amour</i> for U.S. release so it would not be perceived as a martial arts film.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\" style=\"\">The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life.

The \"rolling\" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a>'s gyroscope <a href=\"/motion-control/3015-474\" data-ref-id=\"3015-474\">motion sensor</a>, in 2012.</p><h2>Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\" style=\"\">The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the <a href=\"/hang-on/3030-11570\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11570\">Sega Hang-On</a> system.

The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second.

It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as \"Sega Ages: Space Harrier\" is also a pretty faithful version of the game.

The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as \"Haya Oh.\" This new boss fight also appears in the <a href=\"/sharp-x68000/3045-95\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">X68000</a> version of the game.

The game was supposedly scheduled for release worldwide, but was never released outside the aforementioned territories.</p><p style=\"\">Since it was released so late in the FC/NES lifespan, the game sold poorly. The Japanese release is a bit more common, but the Scandinavian release is now considered to be one of the rarest and most expensive SCN region games released, and is sought after by collectors. It has a cult following these days due to its great gameplay and technically impressive graphics and soundtrack.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\">The intro opens with a girl blowing out candles on her birthday. She receives a present which turns out to be Mr. Gimmick, a plush toy doll. She loves him more than any of her other toys. Because of this, the other toys get jealous and kidnap the girl while she sleeps, taking her into the dimension of toys. Now it's up to Mr. Gimmick to save her.</p><p style=\"\">Mr. Gimmick features two endings. In order to get the good ending, the player must collect a secret item in each of the first six stages of the game without using any continues. Only by doing this is the path to the true final stage and boss unlocked.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817047\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.876\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817047\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/817047-1170738620_00.png\"></a><figcaption>The world map.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mr. Gimmick is a side-scrolling platformer. Mr. Gimmick's only weapon and tool is a star he can create and throw. The star is used to defeat enemies, and can be used to solve simple environmental puzzles.</p><p style=\"\">The star features a simple physics system that affects how it bounces depending on from where it's dropped; the higher it's dropped from, the higher it will bounce. And so if Mr. Gimmick jumps before throwing it, or throws it from a platform, it will bounce higher. Mr. Gimmick can also stand on top of the star as it bounces if he jumps on top of it. Jumping on a thrown star is required to progress in some areas of the game.</p><p style=\"\">In the game's first six levels, Mr. Gimmick must find a hidden item somewhere in the stage, and then defeat the boss at he end. As stated above, to get the good ending and rescue the girl, Mr. Gimmick must collect the hidden item in every level to make the final, secret level appear, and defeat the final boss. If any of the hidden items are missed, or any continues are used, the game will end after the boss on level 6, resulting in a bad ending where the girl is not rescued.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The Japanese version of the game starts Mr. Gimmick out with three lives, while the Scandinavian version starts him out with seven lives.</li></ul><ul><li>The Japanese release had a special version of the AY-3-8910 sound chip, also used in the Amstrad CPC and Atari ST computers, embedded in the MMC chip to help the regular Famicom sound chip with the music. This sound chip was not embedded in the MMC in the Scandinavian release because the NES does not have pins on the connector for external sound chips, instead having four pins for the lockout chip. Because of this, the Scandinavian version's soundtrack is reworked to only use the internal NES sound chip. As a result, some instruments are missing in some songs, or sometimes sound different than in the Japanese version.</li></ul><ul><li>The Scandinavian release, like most of Sunsoft's PAL releases, is optimized for 50hz. Because of this, the soundtrack does not sound correctly when played on an NTSC NES console. Not just that it runs faster, but the digitized drums and DPCM sounds are especially affected. Since the graphics have also been tweaked for the PAL NES, there are also major graphics glitches when playing on an NTSC NES.</li></ul><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630637\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1630637\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9560/1630637-dsc_8600.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The PCB of the Scandinavian release, showing the custom mapper chip (the square-shaped chip).</figcaption></figure><ul><li>The game uses a custom mapper chip, the Sunsoft <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_Management_Controller#FME-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">FME-7</a>, which enhances the graphics capabilities of the console. This was included in both the Japanese and Scandinavian release, though the Japanese version includes the AY-3-8910 sound chip embedded as mentioned previously. Having a custom MMC chip was pretty common for Famicom games, but on the NES it was very unusual. Most other third party games that used a custom mapper chip, like <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a>'s <a href=\"/contra/3030-4350\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4350\">Contra</a>, were reworked for Nintendo's MMC chips when released for NES. This chip, together with the sound chip in the Japanese release, probably added up to make this an expensive game to manufacture.</li></ul>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Chack'n Pop is a single-screen Arcade game from Taito in which the player is a dexterous bird-like creature named Chack'n. The goal of each stage is to descend to the bottom corner to free a heart from its cage, then head back to the top to stop a little monster from cracking one of Chack'n's eggs. Chack'n is capable of walking along ceilings - sort of like the gravity-switching <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16930\" href=\"/viridian/3005-16930\" slug=\"viridian\">Captain Viridian</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29745\" href=\"/vvvvvv/3030-29745\" slug=\"vvvvvv\">VVVVVV</a> - and can also throw bombs that will eliminate enemies within the radius of their explosions. Enemies appear first as harmless eggs, but soon hatch into tenacious monsters that resemble the Blubbas of Bubble Bobble.</p><p style=\"\">The level design, enemies and other graphical flourishes resemble those of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4995\" href=\"/bubble-bobble/3030-4995\" slug=\"bubble-bobble\">Bubble Bobble</a>, Taito's next big Arcade hit and the game the developers are best known for after Space Invaders. Bubble Bobble honors its spiritual ancestor by reusing one of Chack'n Pop's stages. Like Bubble Bobble, Chack'n Pop also received various home versions after its initial Arcade release, including NES, MSX and Sega SG-1000 versions. It also appears in various Taito Arcade compilations, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7781\" href=\"/taito-legends-2/3030-7781\" slug=\"taito-legends-2\">Taito Legends 2</a> for the PS2.</p>",
