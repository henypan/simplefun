As one of several <a href=\"/capcom/3010-367\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom</a>-developed titles based on a licensed <a href=\"/disney/3025-720\" data-ref-id=\"3025-720\">Disney</a> property, the game is based on the animated television series of the same name and follows <a href=\"/chipmunk/3015-3101\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3101\">chipmunk</a> amateur sleuths <a href=\"/chip/3005-16730\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16730\">Chip</a> and <a href=\"/dale/3005-16731\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16731\">Dale</a> as they investigate their latest case.

Gadget notifies the rest of the team that their human neighbor Mandy has lost her kitten, and the Rescue Rangers all agree to help track down the missing pet. Gadget, Monty and Zipper scout ahead while Chip and Dale begin investigating the lab of Professor Norton Nimnul, a known criminal and the creator of several <a href=\"/robot-dog/3055-1465\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1465\">robotic dogs</a> that have recently been spotted around the city.</p><h3>Characters</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/chip/3005-16730\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16730\"><strong>Chip</strong></a>: The no-nonsense <a href=\"/fedora-hat/3055-2509\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2509\">fedora</a>-wearing <a href=\"/chipmunk/3015-3101\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3101\">chipmunk</a> leader of the Rescue Rangers. Chip is often frustrated by Dale's foolish antics, but ultimately knows that he must rely on each of his friends to take on the dangers of the criminal underworld.</li><li><a href=\"/dale/3005-16731\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16731\"><strong>Dale</strong></a>: Chip's buck-toothed best friend. In the animated series, he has a penchant for red <a href=\"/hawaiian-shirt/3055-488\" data-ref-id=\"3055-488\">Hawaiian shirts</a>. Although less intelligent than his straight-laced counterpart, Dale has demonstrated remarkable initiative and even outright heroism when his friends are in trouble.</li><li><strong>Gadget Hackwrench</strong>: A female <a href=\"/mouse/3015-2264\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2264\">mouse</a> with a passion for mechanical <a href=\"/engineer/3015-1338\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1338\">engineering</a>, Gadget is responsible for creating and maintaining the wide range of specialized devices and vehicles used by the Rescue Rangers in their operations. She is also the target of Chip and Dale's <a href=\"/romance/3015-253\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romantic</a> affections on several occasions, a fact to which she seems largely oblivious.</li><li><strong>Monterey \"Monty\" Jack</strong>: A bulky Australian mouse full of blustery tales of his own exploits. Unfortunately, Monty is stricken with both an insatiable lust for <a href=\"/cheese/3055-638\" data-ref-id=\"3055-638\">cheese</a> and a crippling fear of cats; two flaws that often lead the Rescue Rangers into dire situations.</li><li><strong>Zipper</strong>: A fearless housefly with surprising strength. When found in the game, Zipper grants <a href=\"/temporary-invincibility/3015-266\" data-ref-id=\"3015-266\">temporary invincibility</a>.</li><li><strong>Fat Cat</strong>: A large gray tabby cat who wears an expensive business suit and smokes cigars. He is the criminal mastermind of many nefarious schemes involving animals, including the disappearance of Mandy's kitten and Gadget's kidnapping.</li></ul><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers is a standard <a href=\"/8-bit/3015-5951\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5951\">eight-bit</a> platformer similar to other Capcom action-platforming NES titles such as<a href=\"/mega-man/3025-523\" data-ref-id=\"3025-523\"> Mega Man</a> or <a href=\"/ducktales/3030-15799\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15799\">DuckTales</a>. The game utilizes the diminutive size of its <a href=\"/chipmunk/3015-3101\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3101\">chipmunk</a> protagonists to create its environments; at this small scale, everyday objects such as <a href=\"/book/3055-818\" data-ref-id=\"3055-818\">books</a>, <a href=\"/houseplant/3055-4130\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4130\">flowerpots</a> and <a href=\"/ceiling-fan/3055-4618\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4618\">ceiling fans</a> make up the various platforms and obstacles that players must negotiate to reach the end of a level. Rescue Rangers features both single-player and two-player <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">cooperative</a> modes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4848/434893-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-434893\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4848/434893-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-434893\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4848/434893-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot4.gif\"></a><figcaption>Two-player co-op in the first stage</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game also draws on the mechanics of <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-2/3030-7406\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7406\"> Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, specifically the mechanic of picking up and <a href=\"/item-throw/3015-1741\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1741\">throwing items</a> to damage enemies. The same mechanic is in Rescue Rangers where Chip or Dale can pick up objects like apples (or the small boxes that are always scattered around the levels) and throw them at the enemy to stun or knock them out. They can also throw their co-op partner. Similar to <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-wii/3030-26841\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26841\"> New Super Mario Bros Wii</a>, this mechanic is more often humorously used for competition than cooperation, throwing the partners into enemies or off cliffs. The game includes many big bosses and defeating them often includes picking up objects and throwing them at their weak spots.</p><p style=\"\">Zipper acts as the invincibility star. On the rare occasion when the player finds him, they can mow down everything in their path. Players can also collect Flower icons that will often require some searching under boxes to find them all; collecting fifty flowers grants an <a href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\">extra life</a>.</p><h2>Stages</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3384/225265-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225265\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3384/225265-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-225265\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3384/225265-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3384/225265-chip___dales_rescue_rangers_nes_screenshot2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Professor Nimnul's lab</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game takes either Chip or Dale through several locations on their quest to stop the evil suit-wearing feline Fat Cat.

While the plot may sound serious, the game takes advantage of a number of B movie tropes as well as a very unique style of humor that sets the game play in a funny and mostly non-threatening light.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game play utilizes a <a href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75\" data-ref-id=\"3015-75\">point-and-click</a> mechanic that became the standard for most all <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a> game of the time period (and has seen a resurgence again in recent years). In addition to this, the game contains 15 different commands that they player may use to interact with the environments and characters.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The commands are: Push, Pull, Give, Open, Close, Read, Walk To, Pick Up, What Is, New Kid, Unlock, Use, Turn On, Turn Off, and Fix. In addition to these choices, the player is also granted a number of special abilities depending on the characters that have been chosen to accompany Dave. For example, Bernard can repair items while Michael can develop film.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Most of the story is conveyed through the use of cut scenes. In the game's opening cinematic, it is revealed that a meteor landed near the mansion twenty years prior to the game's event, that the meteor is sentient, and that it has taken control of the family, making them into the evil characters that they are.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Maniac Mansion has five successful endings that change depending on which characters are used, which characters have died, and how the player solved certain puzzles throughout the game.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like many other games of the time, <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">Lucasfilm Games</a> was required to heavily censor Maniac Mansion before it could be released on the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Because of this, the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> version is considered to be a somewhat incomplete and lacking experience overall.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A sequel to Maniac Mansion titled <a href=\"/maniac-mansion-day-of-the-tentacle/3030-4372\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4372\">Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle</a> was released in 1993.

Unlike other <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts</a> games, the player could die in Maniac Mansion but finish the game with two characters theoretically.</p><h2>Non-playable Characters</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mansion inhabitants and others:</p><ul><li>Dr. Fred: The mad scientist 20 years in the making.</li><li>Ed: Dr. Fred's son whom is concerned for his father and what he's doing in the basement of their mansion.</li><li>Nurse Edna: Crazy old lady.

As part of a project assigned to them by <a href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">Lucasfilm Games</a>, the two wrote and designed a game based on their love of B movies and their own unique sets of humor.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While they add the basic concepts for the plot, characters, and environment, the two designers had trouble determining a genre of game play. Only after watching his cousin play <a href=\"../../kings-quest/61-9648/\" rel=\"nofollow\">King's Quest: Quest for the Crown</a> during a Christmas visit did <a href=\"../../ron-gilbert/72-2859/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ron Gilbert</a> decide that the graphic adventure game genre would be the best fit for their creation. From there, the two went about created a basic layout for the game in order to determine the overall structure of the game and preliminary programming concepts. At one point, Maniac Mansion was a board game playable on paper in which the mansion's floor plan was the game board and small markers were used to represent characters and items. Due to the complexity of the game's overall structure and the high number of variables, dialogue was not written until some time into the actual programming of the game.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Maniac Mansion is considered a seminal title in video game history. It was lauded for its preset number of commands that made it simpler to focus on puzzlers and where to go rather than what commands could and could not be used. Additionally, its humor-based storytelling set a standard that was followed up by a number of games including the <a href=\"/space-quest/3025-340\" data-ref-id=\"3025-340\">Space Quest</a> and <a href=\"/monkey-island/3025-548\" data-ref-id=\"3025-548\">Monkey Island</a> series.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game's lasting effect on gaming culture can be seen in recent years as well in which fans have created a new version of the game featuring updated graphics and audio, an episodic series of games based on the universe, and live action trailers depicting a fictitious film based on the game.</p><h2>Changes in NES Version</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Due to the strict guidelines Nintendo of America placed on developers, several changes had to be made to the game in order to be released on the NES. Things like profanity had to be removed or edited, for instance Dave's opening line of \"Don't be a shit head\" was changed to \"Don't be a tuna head\" for the NES version.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Other less noticeable things were changed in order to meet Nintendo's standards. For example in the Mansion's arcade room, an arcade machine named \"Muff Diver\" had to be changed to \"Tuna Diver\", or a medical chart in Dr. Fred's office originally had a caption for the brain that read \"Chewy caramel center\", which was changed to \"Pretty brains\"</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The characters themselves or some of the dialog involving characters had to be changed. One exchange between Ed &amp; Edna was as follows. \"<em>Well, Mommy, I'm worried about him. Well, Mommy, I'm worried! He hasn't eaten in 5 years. YEAH, SO!!! and he's been bringing those bodies, and he carries those bodies to the basement at night.</em>\" Nintendo however felt that this exchange indicated that Dr. Fred was a cannibal, even though game designers insisted that was never their intention. The text was eventually changed to \"<em>He hasn't slept in 5 years!</em>\"</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Perhaps the biggest change to the NES version was to the character of Edna. In the earlier versions of the game some of her lines were somewhat sexually suggestive, for example when someone calls her from the phone in the library, she says \"<em>Is this a prank phone Call? There's no heavy breathing. Let me show you how to do it.</em>\" While she says some sexually suggestive things, she is generally portrayed as being pretty sane in earlier versions of the game, whereas in the NES version she seems to be a little bit more off her rocker.</p><h2>References</h2><ul><li>\"Chuck the Plant\" an in-game object has been referenced in games such as <a href=\"/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-the-graphic-adventure/3030-14748\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14748\">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>, <a href=\"/tales-of-monkey-island/3030-32796\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32796\">Tales of Monkey Island</a>, <a href=\"/lone-survivor/3030-37794\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37794\">Lone Survivor</a>, and <a href=\"/the-cave/3030-38390\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38390\">The Cave</a>.</li><li>David Fox in his game <a href=\"/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders/3030-6728\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6728\">Zak McKracken</a> <a href=\"/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders/3030-6728\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6728\">and the</a> <a href=\"/zak-mckracken-and-the-alien-mindbenders/3030-6728\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6728\">Alien Mindbenders</a> as a parody of the chainsaw that required nonexistent gasoline in Maniac Mansion, included a gasoline can (item) for a nonexistent chainsaw.</li><li>Bernard and the Purple Tentacle poster From <a href=\"/maniac-mansion-day-of-the-tentacle/3030-4372\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4372\">Day of the Tentacle</a> can be seen in the living room in the game <a href=\"/ben-there-dan-that/3030-28084\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28084\">Ben There, Dan That</a>.</li></ul>",

The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.</p><p style=\"\">Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.</p><p style=\"\">Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.</p>",

The game has since then been remade on various other platforms including the <a href=\"/wonderswan-color/3045-54\" data-ref-id=\"3045-54\">WonderSwan Color</a>, <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a>. The game does not share any connection with the original Final Fantasy's world or characters, establishing a precedent all entries in the primary Final Fantasy series have since followed.</p><h2>Story</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/295185-beavers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-295185\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/295185-beavers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-295185\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/431/295185-beavers.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Beavers are crucial to the story of Final Fantasy II.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy II is about four heroes, including main protagonist <a href=\"/firion/3005-5195\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5195\">Firion</a>, who join a resistance group called Wild Rose and try to stop the Empire of Palamecia from taking over the world. The dialogue in Final Fantasy II is a lot more dynamic than the first; players can ask <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC</a>s about key terms and items to advance the plot or unlock certain events. It is also the first Final Fantasy where party members can join and leave the party during the game. Final Fantasy II also introduced elements that have since become defining concepts of the Final Fantasy series. It is the first game to feature the <a href=\"/chocobo/3015-259\" data-ref-id=\"3015-259\">chocobo</a>, a mount that would let the player ride across the world without any random encounters, and a character named <a href=\"/cid/3015-4748\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4748\">Cid</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8618/455187-124988_2_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-455187\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 320px\" data-ratio=\"0.56681034482759\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8618/455187-124988_2_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-455187\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8618/455187-124988_2_1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8618/455187-124988_2_1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Battle scene from the PSP remake.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy II's combat and character progression use different systems than were seen in the original game. Instead of gaining <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> to increase in level and raise stats across the board, the heroes gain skill levels for the attributes they use in battle. For example, if they use <a href=\"/sword/3055-1\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">swords</a>, their strength and sword skill will increase; if they get hit in battle, their <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">hit points</a> will increase.</p><p style=\"\">A glitch in the Famicom version of the game registers canceled stat-boosting commands. If the player were to repeatedly input and cancel a particular command, they could conceivably give the related stats a substantial boost before the end of a single battle. This glitch was fixed in later ports.</p><p style=\"\">Final Fantasy II also introduced the idea of <a href=\"/party-system/3015-125\" data-ref-id=\"3015-125\">party formation</a> to the franchise. The player could move their characters to the back of the line in battle, reducing their chances of taking damage while limiting their own attack capabilities to using <a href=\"/bow-and-arrow/3055-73\" data-ref-id=\"3055-73\">bows</a> or magic.</p><h2>Version Differences</h2><p style=\"\">As stated above, Final Fantasy II has seen numerous iterations since its conception. What follows below are the different versions released over the years and the iterative changes with each subsequent release.</p><h3>Famicom (1988 and 1994)</h3><p style=\"\">The original Final Fantasy II was released for the Famicom in Japan and was set to release in North America supposedly with the subtitle Dark Shadow Over Palakia. With the looming release of the Super Nintendo and a long localization process, the 8-bit version never made its way outside of Japan despite the success of the first Final Fantasy and Square advertisements of the beta version. The Famicom version was re-released in Japan as part of a compilation with the first Final Fantasy in 1994. This version still remains exclusive to Japan despite Nintendo's claims that each pre-PlayStation Final Fantasy would be released over its Virtual Console service.</p><h3>WonderSwan Color (2001)</h3><p style=\"\">More than a decade after Final Fantasy II's original release, Square decided to put support behind the WonderSwan Color, a Japan handheld gaming device. Along with this support came re-releases of Final Fantasies I, II and III, whose graphics were updated to suit the 16-bit handheld. The game also had fully drawn backgrounds for battle sequences and remastered audio. Final Fantasy II for the WonderSwan was a release title and was also featured in a limited edition bundle. The bundle included the game, a specially branded system and a premium strap with Final Fantasy II branding.</p><h3>PlayStation (2002 and 2003)</h3><p style=\"\">Nearly 15 years later, gamers outside of Japan could purchase a version of Final Fantasy representative of their own territory. The PlayStation version added CG cutscenes and featured technical improvements beyond that of the WonderSwan Color version. It was released separately or compiled in Japan and released solely as the compilation Final Fantasy Origins overseas.</p><h3>Mobile Phones (2004 and 2006)</h3><p style=\"\">Due to the immense popularity of cell phone gaming in Japan, a mobile phone version was released over three services providers on different dates. The graphics and sound most closely resemble that of the more widely known Game Boy Advance version. This version remains exclusive to Japan.</p><h3>Game Boy Advance (2004)</h3><p style=\"\">This version of Final Fantasy II signaled Square's returning support for Nintendo handhelds as well as Final Fantasy II's first official release in the Australia territory. Released under the compilation Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls, the reworked title also featured a new post-game sequence called Souls of Rebirth, in which players can control the various support characters that died during the main storyline.</p><h3>PlayStation Portable (2007 and 2008)</h3><p style=\"\">To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, Square-Enix brought Final Fantasy II out of the vault once more for the release of Final Fantasy II Anniversary Edition. It is considered as the ultimate version of Final Fantasy II as it includes all the bonuses from previous versions as well as updated graphics and sound, a rebalanced combat system and two extra dungeons.</p><h3>iPhone (2010)</h3><p style=\"\">The iPhone version retains all aspects of the PSP anniversary release. The only main difference between the two versions is the method of control. Whereas the PSP utilizes digital button inputs, the iPhone version is controlled solely by its touch screen interface.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p style=\"\">The original soundtrack was composed by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. The remakes of the game have sound produced and arranged by <a href=\"/tsuyoshi-sekito/3040-94857\" data-ref-id=\"3040-94857\">Tsuyoshi Sekito</a>.</p><h3>PlayStation track listing:</h3><p style=\"\">1. \"Opening Movie\"</p><p style=\"\">2. \"Opening Movie SE\"</p><p style=\"\">3. \"Opening Theme\"</p><p style=\"\">4. \"Prelude\"</p><p style=\"\">5. \"Battle Scene 1\"</p><p style=\"\">6. \"Time of Revival\"</p><p style=\"\">7. \" Reunion\"</p><p style=\"\">8. \"Rebel Army Theme\"</p><p style=\"\">9. \"Town\"</p><p style=\"\">10. \"Main Theme\"</p><p style=\"\">11. \"Pandemonium Castle\"</p><p style=\"\">12. \"Imperial Army Theme\"</p><p style=\"\">13. \"Chocobo's Theme\"</p><p style=\"\">14. \"Tower of Magic-users\"</p><p style=\"\">15. \"Escape!\"</p><p style=\"\">16. \"Ancient Castle\"</p><p style=\"\">17. \"Dungeon\"</p><p style=\"\">18. \"Emperor's Revival\"</p><p style=\"\">19. \"Victory\"</p><p style=\"\">20. \"Waltz\"</p><p style=\"\">21. \"Temptation of the Princess\"</p><p style=\"\">22. \"Dead Music\"</p><p style=\"\">23. \"Fanfare\"</p><p style=\"\">24. \"Include in the Group\"</p><p style=\"\">25. \"Inn\"</p><p style=\"\">26. \"Battle Scene A\"</p><p style=\"\">27. \"Battle Scene B\"</p><p style=\"\">28. \"Battle Scene 2\"</p><p style=\"\">29. \"Finale\"</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">After Burner II is a Z-axis shoot 'em up with a F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and the sequel to Sega's <a href=\"/after-burner/3030-3629\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3629\">After Burner</a>. Using Sega's revolutionary sprite-scaling technology, the After Burner games would increase the velocity of the player's craft to almost dizzying levels as they attempted to avoid missiles and other airborne threats in intense air missions.</p><p style=\"\">Best known for its Arcade version, which could be played in a specially-designed sit-down cabinet shaped like the jet's cockpit, the game would also see multiple home versions for various Sega and non-Sega systems. Many of these home versions struggle to match the speed of the original Arcade After Burner II: a common issue with Sega's sprite-scaling Arcade games. The 1996 Sega Saturn conversion is one of the few to be considered \"Arcade perfect\", as it operated on the same code.</p><p style=\"\">After Burner II would also be adapted for the 3D Classics range for the 3DS, which added 3D compatibility, and was included in the <a href=\"/sega-ages-2500-vol-10-after-burner-ii/3030-39004\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39004\">Sega Ages</a> range of Sega Arcade conversions for the Japanese PS2.</p><h3>Arcade Version</h3><p style=\"\">The arcade version of After Burner II was available in a stand-up model as well as a deluxe sit down cabinet modeled like a fighter jet cockpit. The cockpit was built on hydraulics, which simulated flight by moving the player roughly 25 degrees in both a horizontal and vertical axis, in a rough representation of the fighter's in-game movement. As the cockpit was enclosed on almost all sides, spectators who stood too close to the moving cockpit could be injured, so large screens (simulcasting the gameplay) were frequently mounted above the cabinet. This deluxe version often cost upward of $1.00USD for a single credit.</p><p style=\"\">Stereo speakers were placed at the ear level for the deluxe cabinet version, creating a very immersive (and sometimes deafening) play experience. The arcade controls consisted of a flight stick with multiple buttons and a throttle stick which could be used to slow down the aircraft or activate it's afterburners. The addition of the throttle was the most notable change from the original After Burner.</p><p style=\"\">There 23 stages in the game: Stages 5, 13 and 23 are non-playable landing cutscenes and levels 8 and 17 are canyon bombing runs. The remaining stages involve air to air combat using an unlimited cannon, and a limited supply of missiles.

      "deck": "A top-down circuit style racing game based on the popular toy cars, featuring selectable characters and macro-sized courses based on areas of a suburban home.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Micro Machines is a circuit-type racing game with top-down graphics. Players select a character from a vast roster and race against CPU or human opponents; neither the races nor the cars the player finds himself in are related to the character. Each character has a CPU strength rating but there are zero differences between them when played by human players.</p><p style=\"\">Micro Machines is based on the toy line of the same name of very small collectible car models. To suit their miniature form, each course in the game is set in a region of a regular home: the kitchen table, a games room with a pool table, a garden, etc.</p><p style=\"\">Micro Machines was released on almost every console and home computer system available in 1994. It also saw a sequel: <a href=\"/micro-machines-2-turbo-tournament/3030-20350\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20350\">Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>One Player Mode</h3><p style=\"\"> </p><h4>Head-to-Head</h4><p style=\"\">In this mode there are only two vehicles are in play: one player controlled and one AI. The objective is to gain enough distance between the opponent as to make him stay out of the screen, when this happens the car on screen is awarded a point from the opponent's pool (each player starts with 4 each). These points go back and forth until someone has all eight points or the race ends naturally after three laps.</p><h4>Challenge</h4><p style=\"\">This mode places the player in 25 races against three other AI controlled vehicles. The player starts with a set number of lives, and loses them for each race where they don't place in the top two places. Once they run out of lives, they are eliminated. The AI characters are also eliminated and replaced by stronger opponents as they place badly through the races.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h3>Two Player Mode</h3><h4>Head-to-Head</h4><p style=\"\">This mode is the same as described in the \"One Player\" section, only both vehicles are human-controlled.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h4>Tournament</h4><p style=\"\">In Tournament two players are pitted against each other in the same fashion as Head-to-Head for a series of five races and whoever wins most races out of the five is declared winner.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Vehicles and Environments</h2><p style=\"\">The type of vehicles change, and are fixed for each environment:</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h4>Bathtub - Powerboats</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/1467959-pwboat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1467959\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.60504201680672\" data-width=\"238\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/104355/1467959-pwboat.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1467959\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/10/104355/1467959-pwboat.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">These are standard powerboats with standard handling.

Decent handling and speed but are best suited for bumping each other off the course. The worktop is filled with tools and other impassable objects.</p><h4>Billiards Table - Formula One</h4><p style=\"\">Formula One (or open-wheel) racecars, like in real life, sport extremely high top speeds on straights and high acceleration without a compromise on the corners. The billiards table naturally has a lot of pool balls and cues to get in the players' way.</p><h4>Sandbox - Turbo Wheels</h4><p style=\"\">Dune buggy vehicles designed for the sandy terrain of the sandbox. Obstacles include buckets and spades.</p><h4>Garden - Choppers</h4><p style=\"\">The helicopters have tricky turning cycles but are able to fly over all but the tallest obstacles in the garden course. </p><p style=\"\"> </p><h4>Bedroom floor - Tanks</h4><p style=\"\">Tanks are slow vehicles with poor turning but have the advantage of shooting one's opponent, forcing them to respawn behind the player's location. The goal of these stages is to stay ahead and elude the shots of those behind them. The bedroom floor stage is filled with toys and other obstacles to use as cover.</p><h4>Backyard - Rufftrux</h4><p style=\"\">Huge monster trucks in a special time trial race. Fit through the obstacles to earn a 1up on this stage.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p style=\"\">Although the player's character doesn't determine the racing characteristics of their vehicle, the computer A.I. of each character is different. Spider is notably a very fast opponent.</p>",

This turn based, military strategy game, laid the foundations for the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-17\" href=\"/nintendo-wars/3025-17\">    Nintendo Wars</a> series and introduced its hallmark mechanics and cartoonish style. Although Famicom Wars never saw a release outside of Japan, subsequent games in the series, better known as Advance Wars, became international hits.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5822/575247-famicom_wars_screen_20.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575247\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5822/575247-famicom_wars_screen_20.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-575247\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5822/575247-famicom_wars_screen_20.png\"></a><figcaption> A battle map</figcaption></figure>     Players control one of two armies--Red Star or Blue Moon. The goal is to attack the opposing force by using a variety of land, air and sea units. Each turn, players receive currency based on the number of buildings and facilities they have under their control; they then use this currency to produce more military forces. Players achieve victory by either capturing the enemy's headquarters or clearing the map all visible enemy units. Though gameplay takes place on an overhead, grid-based map, battles between units unfold through short, animated cut scenes.  <br /><br /> The strategy players utilize in Famicom Wars revolves around the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each unit. Units relate to each other in a rock-paper-scissors fashion: jet-fighters are strong against other air units, but weak against anti-air missile launchers; likewise, although anti-air missile launchers can decimate flying foes, they are susceptible to tanks and other ground-based units. Furthermore, only infantry and combat engineers are able to capture enemy and neutral facilities, such as military bases, cities, factories, airports and sea ports.   <br /><br />Terrain also plays a large role in strategy. Whereas roads and flatlands allow for greater unit mobility per turn, they offer little in the way of defense. Forests and mountains, on the other hand, impinge on unit movement but provide a large defense bonus.      <br /><br />Man-made facilities constitute the final element of Famicom Wars gameplay. Each army begins a game with a military base which can create ground units and provides currency each turn. Similarly, captured seaports and airports also offer an amount of funding per turn and allow the creation of sea and air units. Players can further increase the amount of funds they receive by capturing cities. Factories, similar to military bases, allow for the production of ground units, but they are the only facility in the game that does not reward the player with currency.    <br /><br /><h2>Units</h2> <h3>Ground Units</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Infantry </li></ul>   Equipped with a machine-gun, this unit can traverse mountains, forests and rivers. Along with the combat    engineer, this is the only unit able to capture military bases, factories, seaports, airports and cities.     <br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Combat Engineer</li></ul>   Equipped with a missile launcher, the combat engineer's movement is slightly less than regular infantry, but it    excels at attacking land-based vehicles. Along with infantry, this is the only unit able to capture enemy    or neutral facilities.<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Tank</li></ul>   This heavily armored, highly mobile unit comes in two varieties, heavy and light.<br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>APC </li></ul>   The APC is able to transport infantry and combat engineers over long distances, but lacks any sort of weaponry.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Artillery </li></ul>   The long-reaching attack of the artilary unit is balanced by weak amormment and the inability to attack adjacent    units. Like the tank, there are two varieties, heavy and light.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Anti-Air Missile Launcher </li></ul>    Able to attack aircraft at a distance, but it lacks the ability to engage land and sea forces.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Flack Cannon </li></ul>   Similar to the anti-air missle launcher, the flack cannon can only attack air units. It is weaker than its counterpart,    but also cheaper to produce.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Supply Truck</li></ul>   Though it lacks any weaponry, the supply truck can resupply ammunition and gasoline to any units in the field. <br /><br /><h3>Air Units</h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Jet Fighter</li></ul>   This air-to-air unit comes in two varieties, heavy and light.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Bomber </li></ul>   The bomber lacks defensive capabilities, but its range and attack power allows it to decimate land-based units.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Transport Helicopter</li></ul>   An airborne version of the apc--able to transport infantry or combat engineers over long distances.<br /><br /><h3>     Sea Units</h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Battleship</li></ul>   A seaborne version of artillery--Its long range also means it cannot attack directly adjacent units.<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Transport Ship</li></ul>   Similar to its land-based and seaborne brethren, the transport ship can ferry inrantry and combat engineers across    water obstacles.",

The game takes place in a world where a nuclear apocalypse took place in 1997. The survivors of the disaster built a powerful floating tower, with which to govern the world and prevent nuclear war from occurring again.</p><p style=\"\">100 years later, humanity has reverted to an age where the ways of science are forbidden and the people rely on magic. However, the power-hungry Emperor Draygon revives the ways of science in conjunction with magic and attempts to gain control of the floating tower and its advanced technology.</p><p style=\"\">The player character is a young man revived from sleep in a cryogenic stasis chamber. He is soon tasked with the quest to collect the four elemental swords so that the world can be saved. The main character is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1699\" href=\"/nameless-protagonist/3015-1699\" slug=\"nameless-protagonist\">named by the player</a>.

As you defeat enemies, you gain experience points and money which can be used to buy new armor, shields, and various items. There are also spells which you can cast to heal damage, paralyze enemies, or shield yourself from attacks, which require <a data-ref-id=\"3015-98\" href=\"/magic/3015-98\" slug=\"magic\">Magic Points</a>. The level cap is set at 16. Gaining levels is required to beat the game, as enemies who are too strong will take no damage at all from attacks until a certain level is reached.</p><p style=\"\">In combat, there is a meter at the bottom of the screen which represents your current sword's charge level. In addition to close range stab attacks, you can charge up the sword by holding down the attack button while standing still. Letting go of the attack button will release the charge, resulting in a ranged attack. You can also move around while still maintaining your current charge level. Each sword has three levels of charge available, but special items must be obtained and equipped to use the second and third levels, and the third level charge attacks require MP to use.</p><p style=\"\">There are four swords used during the main game, representing the elements of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">The game is regarded as a classic in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a>, where it was well-received and considered an innovator when it first released in 1984. While it had some similarities to two other real-time action RPG's released earlier that year, <a href=\"/dragon-slayer/3030-15158\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15158\">Dragon Slayer</a> and <a href=\"/the-tower-of-druaga/3030-4567\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4567\">The Tower of Druaga</a>, Hydlide departed from them in several ways.</p><p style=\"\">While Dragon Slayer and The Tower of Druaga were mostly <a href=\"/dungeon-crawling/3015-165\" data-ref-id=\"3015-165\">dungeon crawlers</a>, Hydlide was a more <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> game, with outdoor fields to explore. Other innovations include being able to switch between attack mode and defense mode, quick save and load options which can be done at any moment of the game through the use of <a title=\"Password (video games)\" href=\"/password/3015-38\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">passwords</a> as the primary back-up, and the introduction of a <a title=\"Health (gaming)\" href=\"/regenerating-health/3015-83\" data-ref-id=\"3015-83\">health regeneration</a> mechanic where health and magic slowly regenerate when standing still.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style=\"\">Along with <a href=\"/dragon-slayer/3025-783\" data-ref-id=\"3025-783\">Dragon Slayer</a>, Hydlide was one of the games that inspired the hugely successful <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda</a> franchise, and in turn many of its clones. Hydlide also had an influence on on the acclaimed action RPG series, <a title=\"Ys (series)\" href=\"/ys/3025-112\" data-ref-id=\"3025-112\">Ys</a>, which, for example, uses a similar <a href=\"/regenerating-health/3015-83\" data-ref-id=\"3015-83\">health-regeneration</a> mechanic. This recharging health mechanic first introduced by Hydlide in 1984 would, decades later, become a common mechanic widely used in many video games, including most modern <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> and <a href=\"/third-person-perspective/3015-464\" data-ref-id=\"3015-464\">third-person</a> shooters.</p><p style=\"\">Despite the game's legacy in Japan, and its importance in gaming history, it has unfortunately acquired a mostly negative reputation in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a>. The game took several years to release in North America, by which time <a title=\"The Legend of Zelda\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">The Legend of Zelda</a> had a more refined, advanced take on the action-RPG formula. Hydlide was thus criticized by American audiences as being primitive in comparison, and some even accused it of being a Zelda clone, unaware of Hydlide's original 1984 release and its influence on Zelda.</p><p style=\"\"> </p>",

Star Tropics is an anomaly in that the game was developed exclusively for American and European audiences, and has never seen the light of day in Japan. The game was developed by a team of Japanese game designers living in the U.S., the same team responsible for the <a href=\"/mike-tysons-punch-out/3030-4848\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4848\">Punch-Out!! </a>games. The game has been re-released on the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii virtual console </a>for both North American and PAL regions as of January 2008.</p><h2>Story</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">StarTropics tells the story of <a href=\"/mike-jones/3005-11429\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11429\">Mike Jones </a>, a teenager and all-star pitcher from the mainland U.S., arrives on C-Island to visit his archaeologist uncle, Dr. Steve Jones. Upon his arrival, he finds that his uncle has gone missing, and absolutely no one knows where he went. Mike, determined to discover the whereabouts of his beloved uncle, arms himself with baseball parephernelia, and sets off on his quest. He'll battle a giant octopus, cure diseases, fight zombies and moai heads, on his long and perilous journey.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393248\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393248\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3401/393248-start005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The overworld. </figcaption></figure><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">StarTropics is a mix of console RPG and action-adventure elements. Outside of dungeon areas, the player moves around the <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld </a>map and villages, talks to others, collects items and solves the occasional puzzle. Inside dungeons, the viewpoint switches to a zoomed in top-down perspective. The player must guide Mike from room to room, jumping over traps and gaps, trigger switches, and fight off enemies using an assortment of weapons ranging from the basic yo-yo to an alien laser gun and a magic snow man doll capable of freezing enemies.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"/health/3015-130\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\"> Health </a>is monitored in an identical fashion to the <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\">Legend of Zelda </a>series, with a display of hearts that empties as Mike takes damage. The life meter can be extended by finding heart containers scattered throughout the game.</p><h2>The Secret Password</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When StarTropics was released on the NES, the game was packaged with a letter from Mike's uncle. Although it looked like a fairly standard if useless game trinket, information hidden within the paper was actually required to complete the game. There comes a point in the game where Mike is stranded on an island, and in order to get the Sub-C back on course, he must enter a three digit <a href=\"/password/3015-38\" data-ref-id=\"3015-38\">password</a>. The player is given a hint to apply water to the letter in order to reveal the code required to continue. In an era before the internet and online FAQs, if the player either did not understand that the game referred to the letter that came with the game or had lost the letter entirely, then they would not be able to progress any further into the game without guessing the correct passcode: 747.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When StarTropics was released on the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>, Nintendo got around this <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle </a>by including the letter from Dr. Jones in the game's Home Menu operations guide. By clicking an icon in the letter that depicted a sheet of paper being dipped in water, the password is revealed.</p>",

      "description": "<br/>Victory Road was a significant thematic departure from the original Ikari Warriors game, which had a conventional military theme. Unlike in the first game, in Victory Road the protagonists do battle in an otherworldly dark fantasy realm filled with strange monsters, instead of in jungles populated with soldiers and tanks. <br/> <br/>The game also incorporated digitized speech. In the opening scene, a stone-headed creature circles the screen, taunting and laughing at the player in clear English. <br/> <br/>Apart from the dramatic change of scenery compared with the original, one of the unusual design choices in Victory Road is that it starts you off with one of the game's most powerful weapons, a bazooka. In other vertical-scrolling shooters of the era, it was conventional for the player to start in his weakest form, so having a good starting weapon helped make the first-time experience of playing Victory Road feel different from similar games. <br/> <br/>Like its predecessor, Victory Road is a one- or two-player game that uses special joysticks with twistable heads. Twisting the head of the stick changes the direction the player character is facing, which allows players to fire in a direction independent of their direction of movement. <br/> <br/>This mechanic also enabled one of Victory Road's original weapons, a sword, which could be used to kill enemies at close range by rotating the joystick.",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Galaxian (ギャラクシアン) is an <a href=\"/arcade/3045-84\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">Arcade </a>game that was developed by <a title=\"Namco\" href=\"/namco/3010-7420\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco</a> and released in October 1979. It was published by Namco in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan </a>and imported to <a title=\"North America\" href=\"/north-america/3035-1664\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> by <a title=\"Midway Games\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway</a> that December. A <a href=\"/vertical-scrolling/3015-1899\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1899\">vertical scrolling</a> shooter game in which the player controls a <a title=\"Spaceship\" href=\"/spaceship/3055-17\" data-ref-id=\"3055-17\">spaceship</a> at the bottom of the screen, and shoots enemies descending in various directions, it was designed to compete with <a href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135\" data-ref-id=\"3010-135\">Taito</a>'s successful earlier game <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a> (which was released in the previous year, and also imported to the US by Midway).</p><p style=\"\">The game was a big hit for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since.</p><p style=\"\">It was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Bally Astrocade, Nintendo Famicom, and home computers.</p><p style=\"\">It spawned a successful sequel, <a title=\"Galaga\" href=\"/galaga/3030-15784\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15784\">Galaga</a>, in 1981, and the lesser known <a href=\"/galaga-3/3030-18690\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18690\">Gaplus</a> and <a title=\"Galaga '88\" href=\"/galaga-88/3030-14593\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14593\">Galaga '88</a> in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the <a title=\"Golden age of arcade video games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">golden age of Arcade video games</a>.</p><h2>Description</h2><p style=\"\">Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a>. As in the earlier game, Galaxian features a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, Galaxianadded an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make <a title=\"Kamikaze\" href=\"/kamikaze/3015-1189\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1189\">kamikaze</a>-like dives at the player's <a title=\"Starship\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship\" rel=\"nofollow\">ship</a>, the Galaxip. This made it the first game to feature enemies with individual personalities. The game's plot consists of a title screen that displayed the message \"WE ARE THE GALAXIANS / MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS\".</p><p style=\"\">Galaxian was very successful for Namco and introduced several \"firsts\". Although not the first color video game, Galaxian took <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">RGB color</a> graphics a step further with multi-colored animated sprites and explosions, different colored fonts for the score and high score, the <a title=\"Scrolling\" href=\"/vertical-scrolling/3015-1899\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1899\">vertical scrolling</a> starfield, and graphic icons that show the number of lives left and how many stages the player had completed. It also features a crude theme song and more prominent background music/sound effects. These elements combine to create a look and feel that would set the standard for arcade games in the 1980s such as <a title=\"Pac-Man\" href=\"/pac-man/3025-463\" data-ref-id=\"3025-463\">Pac-Man</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The objective is destroy endless 'waves' of enemies. The enemy ships are arranged in a formation at the top of the screen. At regular intervals enemy ships on the sides of the formation swoop down and shoot at the player. There are 4 different types of enemy ship, each type behaves differently on its attacking run.</p><p style=\"\">The player must destroy all ships in a wave to complete it. With a minor exception that one yellow ship may disappear after a bombing run and will appear as an extra yellow ship in the following wave. The yellow ships attack in a formation with two red ships, the order these three are destroyed determines the points awarded for destroying the yellow. The maximum is 800 points if the two reds are destroyed first. Once a wave has been completed a red flag is added to the bottom of the screen. When 10 flags are accumulated they are replaced by a larger flag.</p><p style=\"\">The player has 3 lives at the beginning of the game. A bonus life is awarded when the player reaches a score of 7000 points. Once all lives have been lost the game ends. The player can only have one shot on screen at one time. This means if the player misses he must wait until the shot leaves the top of the screen to fire again. This makes accuracy very important.</p><h3>High Score</h3><p style=\"\">The current world record score for Galaxian is 1,653,270 points.</p><h2>Development and Release</h2><p style=\"\">The game was developed by <a href=\"/namco/3010-7420\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco </a>in 1979, and released in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan </a>that year. It was designed to build and improve upon the formula of <a href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135\" data-ref-id=\"3010-135\">Taito</a>'s game <a href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a>, which revolutionized the gaming industry upon its release a year earlier. Galaxian incorporated new technology into its dedicated arcade system board, the Namco Galaxian. Unlike Space Invaders, which was black &amp; white and featured enemies that could only move vertically and horizontally as they descended, Galaxian had a color screen and enemies that descended in patterns and came from various directions. The result was more complex and difficult game play.</p><p style=\"\">In 1980, Namco partnered with the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">American </a>company <a href=\"/midway-games/3010-185\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway </a>to release the game in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a>. Midway had previously published Space Invaders in the market, but had to seek new foreign partners when Taito decided to market their games themselves.</p><h2>Reception of Ports</h2><p style=\"\">Home Computing Weekly in 1983 gave the <a href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16\" data-ref-id=\"3045-16\">Spectrum </a>version of Galaxian 3/5 stars describing it as a well-written version and praising the graphics as fast although flickery. <a title=\"Softline (magazine)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softline_(magazine)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Softline</a> in 1983 criticized the <a title=\"Atari 8-bit\" href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">Atari 8-bit</a> version of the game for being shipped on cartridge, which raised its cost, and stated that \"this game becomes tedious very quickly\". <a title=\"Famicom Tsūshin\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famicom_Ts%C5%ABshin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Famicom Tsūshin</a> in 1995 scored the <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a> version of the game a 24 out of 40.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p style=\"\">Galaxian has spawned several follow-up games. The most popular of these was its immediate successor, <a title=\"Galaga\" href=\"/galaga/3030-15784\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15784\">Galaga</a>, which largely eclipsed its predecessor in popularity, introducing aliens attacking in intricate formations, multiple shots, and bonus stages. A third official sequel, Gaplus, was released in 1984. As with Galaga, this was a fixed shooter, with limited vertical movement. However, by 1984, the novelty of the Space Invaders formula had faded, and it was no longer successful. A fourth sequel, <a title=\"Galaga '88\" href=\"/galaga-88/3030-14593\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14593\">Galaga '88</a>, was released in 1987, and imported to North America by <a title=\"Atari Games\" href=\"/atari-games/3010-794\" data-ref-id=\"3010-794\">Atari Games</a>. Namco then released <a href=\"/galaxian3/3030-31950\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31950\">Galaxian 3</a> in 1990. A final sequel, Galaga Arrangement, was released as part of the <a title=\"Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1\" href=\"/namco-classic-collection-vol-1/3030-23911\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23911\">Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1</a>, in 1995.</p><h3>Ports</h3><p style=\"\">The original arcade version of Galaxian has been <a title=\"Porting\" href=\"/porting/3015-988\" data-ref-id=\"3015-988\">ported</a> to many different systems.

It was developed by Virgin Interactive for many home systems, such as the Commodore 64.</p><p style=\"\">In 1988 the game was reworked by Japanese company Hect to more closely resemble a Zelda-like top-down view (opposed to the original's side-scrolling perspective) and was drastically changed graphically.

Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then <a href=\"/rotoscoping/3015-1249\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1249\"> rotoscoped</a> the film to create the animations that give the <a href=\"/the-prince/3005-2623\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2623\"> Prince</a> his fluid movement.</p><p style=\"\">Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on <a href=\"/environmental-puzzles/3015-3129\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3129\"> environmental puzzle-solving</a>, as well as its one-on-one <a href=\"/duel/3015-3027\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3027\"> sword duels</a>. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's <a href=\"/acrobatics/3015-738\" data-ref-id=\"3015-738\"> acrobatics</a> in a <a href=\"/environmental-kill/3015-5116\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5116\"> dangerous environment</a>.</p><p style=\"\">Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the <a href=\"/amiga/3045-1\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\"> Amiga</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\"> Apple Macintosh</a>, DOS, <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\"> NES</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\"> Game Boy</a>, <a href=\"/genesis/3045-6\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\"> Sega Genesis</a>, <a href=\"/game-gear/3045-5\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\"> Game Gear</a>, <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\"> SNES</a>, <a href=\"/sharp-x68000/3045-95\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\"> Sharp X68000</a>, <a href=\"/atari-st/3045-13\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\"> Atari ST</a>, and SAM Coupé.</p><p style=\"\">The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father, <a href=\"/francis-mechner/3040-10282\" data-ref-id=\"3040-10282\"> Francis Mechner</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to <a href=\"/damsel-in-distress/3015-100\" data-ref-id=\"3015-100\"> rescue his princess</a> before she <a href=\"/marriage/3015-2422\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2422\"> weds</a> <a href=\"/jaffar/3005-2061\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2061\"> Jaffar</a>, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the <a href=\"/princess/3015-3214\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3214\"> Princess</a>, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in <a href=\"/real-time-game-clock/3015-2519\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2519\"> real time</a>, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.</p><p style=\"\">The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden <a href=\"/switch/3055-2026\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2026\"> switches</a>, secret <a href=\"/pit/3015-848\" data-ref-id=\"3015-848\"> pitfalls</a> and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden <a href=\"/potion/3055-79\" data-ref-id=\"3055-79\"> potions</a> that have a variety of effects on the Prince.</p><p style=\"\">The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past <a href=\"/guards/3015-4858\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4858\"> guards</a> to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when <a href=\"/projectiles/3015-3\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3\"> projectile weapons</a> were the norm.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=\"\">The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his <a href=\"/throne/3055-2425\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2425\"> throne</a> while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young <a href=\"/orphan/3015-2205\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2205\"> orphan</a> finally sees the Princess, <a href=\"/love/3015-1431\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1431\"> they fall in love</a>. The couple intend to marry.</p><p style=\"\">The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest <a href=\"/dungeon/3035-1131\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\"> dungeon</a> and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical <a href=\"/hourglass/3055-4291\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4291\"> hourglass</a>, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.</p><p style=\"\">The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/755214-1167320125_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-755214\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87109375\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/755214-1167320125_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-755214\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/9408/755214-1167320125_00.png\"></a><figcaption>The SNES version</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received <a href=\"/prince-of-persia-2-the-shadow-the-flame/3030-8688\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8688\"> two</a> <a href=\"/prince-of-persia-3d/3030-10863\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10863\"> proper</a> <a href=\"/sequel/3015-3178\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3178\"> sequels</a> and a <a href=\"/prince-of-persia-classic/3030-18940\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18940\"> 3D remake</a>. <a href=\"/ubisoft-entertainment/3010-82\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\"> Ubisoft</a> re-imagined the series with its <a href=\"/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5235\"> Sands of Time</a> <a href=\"/prince-of-persia/3025-431\" data-ref-id=\"3025-431\"> trilogy</a>, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply <a href=\"/prince-of-persia/3030-20961\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20961\"> Prince of Persia</a>. A motion picture based on <a href=\"/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/3030-5235\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5235\"> Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by <a href=\"/jerry-bruckheimer/3040-74887\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74887\"> Jerry Bruckheimer</a>. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and <a href=\"/ben-kingsley/3040-98710\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98710\"> Ben Kingsley</a> and was received with average reviews.</p><p style=\"\">The game was <a href=\"/remake/3015-340\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\"> ported</a> many times, and version such as the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\"> SNES</a> one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.</p><p style=\"\">The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.</p><h2>Critical Reception</h2><p style=\"\">When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, \"...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly\".</p>",

It is revealed, however that he has wandered into <a href=\"/wario/3005-24\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24\">Wario</a>'s Woods and become lost, whilst Wario's monsters invade the <a href=\"/the-mushroom-kingdom/3035-14\" data-ref-id=\"3035-14\">Mushroom Kingdom</a>. Wanda, <a href=\"/birdo/3005-957\" data-ref-id=\"3005-957\">Birdo</a> and Toad all fight the monsters.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">The game plays similarly to <a href=\"/puyo-puyo/3025-427\" data-ref-id=\"3025-427\">Puyo Puyo</a>. Toad is the main hero, with Birdo providing encouragement and Wanda helping Toad by giving him bombs to destroy the monsters. Monsters must be lined up with at least three in a row of a color with at least one bomb to be removed. Toad can pick up and drop monsters and bombs one at a time, and he can also run up the walls of the tree.</p><p style=\"\">If Toad takes too long to complete a level, Wario grabs Birdo and replaces Wanda with a Pidgit, both of whom throw more monsters at Toad.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/512957-warioswoods_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-512957\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/512957-warioswoods_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-512957\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5312/512957-warioswoods_28.png\"></a><figcaption>NES Version</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href=\"/wario/3005-24\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24\">Wario</a></li><li>Fuzz</li><li>Spud</li><li>Squeak</li><li>Beaker</li><li>Scram</li><li>Dovo</li><li>Spook</li><li><a href=\"/akuman/3005-17349\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17349\">Akuman</a></li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p style=\"\">The game includes a two-player versus mode.

A line of three causes it to rise by one row, a line of four by two, etc.</li><li>Clearing lines of four causes the opponent's block to drop by one row, five by two, etc.</li><li>Clearing a line of five or more causes a crystal of a color (possibly the one with the least monsters on screen) to appear. Destroying the crystal causes all the monsters of its color to disappear.</li><li>Chain reactions cause the big block to rise on the player's side and cause a column of monsters of a color to appear on the opponent's side.</li><li>Clearing two (or more) lines simultaneously causes an egg (or more) to appear on the opponent's side. If the egg hatches, a row of monsters of a specific color will appear.</li></ul>",

The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1468\" href=\"/boulder/3055-1468\">   boulders</a> that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1191\" href=\"/kill-screen/3015-1191\">   \"kill screen\"</a> and the game either froze up or  reset itself.<br /><br /> Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\" href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624\">   Pac-Man</a>. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however.

Nasty (Hard). As you would expect, the aim of the game is to get down to the finish line as fast as possible, whilst avoiding the trees, snowmen, sledding children, and other obstacles. The player must ski between the flags to maintain speed and also may hit moguls for a time bonus.</p><p style=\"\">Slalom is a skiing game, but it wasn't always this way. In the early stages of development the aim was for the team to make a racing engine to run on the NES, but they later discovered that by making the track white and the sides grey, the lack of detail made for a much more seamless experience when scrolling. This is why Rare picked the skiing theme for their engine, keeping the basis simple meant that the only noticeable scrolling elements were skiing related such as flags, snowmen, etc.</p><p style=\"\">Another notable element of Slalom is the attention to detail on the sprite of the playable skier. The sprite detail is very impressive for the time, and the animation is extremely well done, but probably the most notable point to make, is the amount care and attention that went in to shaping the skier's buttocks.</p>",

      "deck": "Duck Hunt was one of the original NES launch titles, featuring a lightgun, ducks and a laughing blood-hound.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Duck Hunt was first developed in conjunction with the Laser Clay Shooting System. This system was a light gun simulation made by <a href=\"../../nintendo/65-90/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo</a>. The game itself was created by <a href=\"../../nintendo-rd1/65-928/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nintendo Research and Development Team 1</a> in 1973, a time before Nintendo had branched into game development. The game was directed by <a href=\"../../takehiro-izushi/72-6177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Takehiro Izushi</a> and produced by <a href=\"../../gunpei-yokoi/72-45151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gunpei Yokoi</a>. The same team were responsible for the creation and development of the light gun used by the game. The game's original soundtrack was composed by <a href=\"../../koji-kondo/72-606/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Koji Kondo</a> and <a href=\"../../hirokazu-tanaka/72-51028/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hirokazu Tanaka</a>.</p><p style=\"\">A home version of Duck Hunt was later included as part of a two-game package with the original <a href=\"../../super-mario-bros/61-15544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mario Bros.</a> for the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NES</a> in 1984. It was later included in a <a href=\"/super-mario-bros-duck-hunt-world-class-track-meet/3030-19967\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19967\">three-in-one game cartridge</a> that also included Super Mario Bros. and <a href=\"/stadium-events/3030-7309\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7309\">World Class Track Meet</a>. The NES version of Duck Hunt was the first game to make use of the Zapper Light Gun NES peripheral.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">There are three game modes: 1 Duck, 2 Ducks, and Clay Pigeons. In 1 Duck and 2 Ducks, the game is set in a wetlands where the player's hunting <a href=\"/duck-hunt-dog/3005-3335\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3335\">dog</a> chases ducks out of a marsh. Each round tasks the player with shooting a series of ducks out of the air with the Zapper. Depending on the mode selected, one or two ducks will appear at a time. To progress to the next round, the player must shoot down a set number of ducks, with the number of ducks required to progress increasing as the player proceeds further into the game. Each time a duck (or pair of ducks) flies on screen, the player is given three shots. If the player misses with all three shots, the ducks will fly away.</p><p style=\"\">Should the player fail to shoot down any ducks in a set, the dog will rise out of the marsh and laugh at the player before the next ducks appear on screen. The dog will also laugh at the player when a Game Over occurs by failing to shoot enough ducks to proceed to the next round. Though it's not possible to shoot the dog in the NES version of the game, it is possible to do so in <a href=\"/vs-duck-hunt/3030-38094\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38094\">Vs. Duck Hunt</a>, the arcade version.</p><p style=\"\">In the Clay Pigeon mode, the game is set on a shooting range in which clay pigeon targets are launched into the air and fly into the distance. Similar to the duck-hunting modes, the player must shoot down a set number of pigeons to advance to subsequent rounds.</p><h2>References in Other Games</h2><p style=\"\">Duck Hunt’s characters have since made appearances in other games. The dog can be seen in <a href=\"../../barker-bills-trick-shooting/61-8177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barker Bill’s Trick Shooting</a>, and in <a href=\"../../super-smash-bros-brawl/61-20588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Smash Brothers Brawl</a> a trophy featuring ducks from the game can be unlocked.</p><p style=\"\">In <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-35573\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35573\">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS</a>, both the dog and a duck are a playable fighter collectively called Duck Hunt. The duo's special moves and Final Smash reference various light gun games.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Technical Details About the Light Gun</h2><p style=\"\">The Zapper Light Gun, like all light gun peripherals of a similar design, is essentially a light sensor in a barrel. When the player presses the trigger, the game screen turns black for a brief moment, save for a small white square that appears on screen in position of a valid target. The player scores a hit if the light sensor in the barrel detects a white square on the screen.</p><p style=\"\">The nature of the technology involved makes it easy to essentially cheat at Duck Hunt. For example, by simply pointing the gun at a lamp, the game always registers hits. Also, by putting a magnifying lens in front of the barrel, the player can make the Zapper see a larger part of the screen, which lessens the need for correct aiming.</p><p style=\"\">When there is more than one target on the screen, instead of showing a black screen with a white spot, the game will show the light gun a black screen and then a plain white screen. Because the entire screen is turned white in this instance, the nature of the gun/screen interface changes.</p><p style=\"\">If a screen has only four pixels, with pixel A on the top right hand corner, B top left hand corner, C in the bottom left hand corner, and D in the bottom right hand corner, the four pixels will become white in the following order A, B, C, and then D.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4244/534594-nes_zapper.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-534594\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.62068965517241\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4244/534594-nes_zapper.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-534594\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4244/534594-nes_zapper.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Arms of the trade.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For the purposes of this explanation, this screen cycles from all black to all white in the following order. (Note that the actual time is much faster than the milliseconds used to illustrate.)</p><ul><li>millisecond 0: all black</li><li>millisecond 1: A white BCD black</li><li>millisecond 2: AB white CD black</li><li>millisecond 3: ABC white D black</li><li>millisecond 4: ABCD white</li></ul><p style=\"\">If the target is at pixel B and the player is aiming correctly, the screen turns black when the trigger is pulled, and then the screen starts to become white. After two milliseconds, pixel B will become white and the light gun will send a positive signal to the NES. The NES knows that the target was at pixel B and that after the player pulled the trigger, it took two milliseconds for the Zapper to send the signal to the console. By doing some calculations, the game can then recognize that the target has been shot. Duck Hunt uses this technique to allow for more than one target on screen at a time.</p><h3>CRT Requirement</h3><p style=\"\">Duck Hunt and other light gun titles of the era were designed to function based on the mechanics of a cathode ray tube (CRT) television. Specifically, the light gun is designed to work with the way a CRT display refreshes the displayed image from frame to frame. Different latency in later model high definition (HD) displays accounts for the problems with light gun functionality on these devices.</p><h2>Wii U Virtual Console Release</h2><p style=\"\">Duck Hunt will become the first light gun shooter released in the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a> line of classic game rereleases. Its release on the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> requires the player use a <a href=\"/wii-remote/3000-13\" data-ref-id=\"3000-13\">Wii Remote</a> to play. Because the Wii Remote pointer functions via an IR sensor, it avoids the limitations of a light gun peripheral and thus allows for the game to be playable on an HD flat-screen television display.</p>",

Abadox had an extensive TV commercial campaign, advertising the level of difficulty as a primary feature. The game received minimal press and mediocre reviews upon release, although the soundtrack was praised, mostly due to the involvement of <a href=\"/kyouhei-sada/3040-48452\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48452\">Kyouhei Sada</a>, a composer known for his work on <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a> games, such as the <a href=\"/contra/3025-605\" data-ref-id=\"3025-605\">Contra</a> franchise.</p><p style=\"\">Abadox takes place in 5012, where the galaxy faces a threat known as the Parasitis.

Players fight across six stages, destroying grotesque aliens resembling internal organs. Levels vary from side-scrolling missions, and downwards scrolling missions, while the final level after defeating the boss of the game is more of an obstacle course than any level before it. Players have three initial lives, and after these are depleted the player must restart the level. Due to this, as well as the bullet-hell nature of some of the game's later levels, Abadox was infamous for its difficulty.</p><p style=\"\">Like many other space shooters of its day, Abadox features a power-up system similar to <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\">Gradius</a> or <a href=\"/r-type/3030-13745\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13745\">R-Type</a>.</p><p style=\"\">There are five weapons, as well as a shield upgrade (which causes several spheres to rotate around the player, destroying anything they touch).

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Millipede is the sequel to Atari's <a href=\"/centipede/3030-1157\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1157\">Centipede</a>. Designed by <a href=\"/ed-logg/3040-38278\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38278\">Ed Logg</a>, it takes some of the familiar elements from Centipede and changes them graphically, while adding completely new elements, including new enemies and a new weapon. The arcade game features a trackball controller for precise movement.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Gameplay is similar to the Centipede's: Players control the Archer, a shooter bounded by the bottom third of the screen. Only one bullet can be on-screen at a time. If struck once by any enemy or bullet, the Archer is destroyed. The game field is populated with mushrooms which serve as obstacles, minor points when destroyed, and can be used by enemy and the player to block or accelerate movement of the main enemy, the millipede.</p><p style=\"\">Once all of a millipede is destroyed, all mushrooms move down one step toward the player field, and the next round starts, usually marked by a new swarm of enemies and the color of the playfield changing.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><h2>Enemies</h2><p style=\"\"><strong>The Millipede</strong> is the focus of the game, and moves predictably. Shooting it in one of its middle sections will spawn two millipedes with the remaining body length. The millipede will divide in this way each time it is shot, unless the head or tail segments are shot. When the millipede reaches the bottom, in addition to spawning new heads, the body will break up and plague the Archer's playfield.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>Spiders</strong> function as in Centipede, consuming mushrooms and jumping erratically, mostly within the player zone. The player gets a higher score if the spider is shot when it is very near the Archer. Should a spider eat many mushrooms, a Bee (the equivalent of the Flea from Centipede) is likely to spawn.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>Bees</strong> fly in a straight line from the top of the screen down to the bottom, spawning mushrooms in its wake. It can be killed by multiple shots, and is spawned when there are few if any mushrooms. This requirement can cause many Bees to be spawned in succession as they try to repopulate the playing field with mushrooms.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>Dragonflies</strong> act similarly to the Bee, spawning mushrooms. Its flight pattern is that of a wave, making it harder to hit. Unlike the Bee, they only have a single hit point. They also spawn more mushrooms on average than Bees do.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>The Earwig</strong> poisons mushrooms. It starts near the top of the screen, moving left or right, and any mushroom it runs across becomes poisoned. A poisoned mushroom is worth more points, but also sends the millipede directly down the screen. The Earwig is one of the top scoring targets in the game.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>Beetles</strong> are slow, but when they run over mushrooms they actually transform them into flowers, which are indestructible.The Beetle also moves in a 'U' shaped attack pattern, entering the screen at a side, then moving down near the bottom, then ascending before it leaves, threatening the Archer with collision and converting mushrooms into impenetrable obstacles. Killing a Beetle makes mushrooms move down one row. All flowers become mushrooms again when a life is lost.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\"><strong>Mosquitos</strong> fly down at a 45 degree angle. When killed, all mushrooms move up one row, clearing them away from the player zone. This may destroy DDT bombs and prompt Bee spawning.</p><h2>Beneficial or benign Creatures and Objects</h2><p style=\"\">The mushroom is the mainstay of the game. It has multiple hit points and can block the Archer from moving. It can also help to corral millipedes, making them easier to hit. Any mushroom partially destroyed is restored when killed, resulting in a small bonus.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">A poisoned mushroom is one touched by an Earwig. It is worth more points when destroyed, and is restored to normal upon death.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Flowers are Beetle-converted mushrooms, and are indestructible. They revert to regular mushrooms and give points similar to the way partially destroyed mushrooms do.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">DDT Bombs spawn at the top of the screen as mushrooms do when a Beetle or Millipede is fully killed. Shooting the bomb results in a cloud of lateral smoke in both directions. Any enemy caught in the cloud is instantly killed and scored.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Inchworms are creatures that are beneficial if shot. Shooting one causes the game to slow down for a short period of time, making targeting enemies much easier.</p><h2>Scoring</h2><ul><li>Millipede body segment: 10 points</li><li>Millipede head: 100 pts.</li><li>Spider (long distance): 300 pts.</li><li>Spider (mid-distance): 600 pts.</li><li>Spider (short distance): 900 pts.</li><li>Spider (point blank): 1200 pts.</li><li>Spider (with DDT Bomb): 1800 pts.</li><li>Beetle: 300 pts.</li><li>Mosquito: 400 pts.</li><li>Bee: 200 pts.</li><li>Inchworm: 100 pts.</li><li>DDT Bomb: 800 pts.</li><li>Dragonfly: 500 pts.</li><li>Earwig: 1000 pts.</li><li>Mushroom: 1 pt.</li><li>Mushroom regeneration: 5 pts. per poisoned, partly destroyed, or enflowered mushroom upon death</li></ul><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">Swarms, which happen every 4th round, give bonus points for every successive insect obliterated. They are made up of different insects depending on the round, and can net a large bonus if enough are shot.</p><h2>Round Progression</h2><p style=\"\">Every five rounds, mushrooms regenerate on their own. They obey the laws laid down by mathematician John Horton Conway in his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Game of Life</a>, with some special exceptions: DDT bombs poisoning neighboring mushrooms (naturally), and mushrooms adjacent to poisoned mushrooms dying off. Flowers count as mushrooms to determine if they generate or kill off others, or kill off themselves.</p><p style=\"\"> </p><p style=\"\">There are spider swarm waves which have as many as eight spiders on the screen at once (instead of the usual two) and waves where mushrooms move down much quicker than normal, making it much harder to maneuver and control the environment.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Lethal Weapon is an action platformer game from Eurocom and was created to coincide with the third Lethal Weapon movie, which was released the same year. The cover art is taken from the movie poster for Lethal Weapon 3. The game includes elements from the movie (such as the antagonist Jack Travis and Joe Pesci's returning comic relief character Leo Getz) but doesn't closely follow the plot.</p><h3>NES and Game Boy Version</h3><p style=\"\">This version is a side-scroller brawler/shooter in which the player assumes either Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson's character) or Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover's character) and fights through hordes of criminals with their guns and fists. The player can also throw grenades should they find any, which can clear out small groups of enemies at once.</p><h3>Super Nintendo Version</h3><p style=\"\">In this platformer, the player controls either both Riggs and Murtaugh - Riggs fires faster and Murtaugh jumps higher (presumably no offense was meant) - and plays through five missions set in different locations. The fifth and final stage has the duo arrest Jack Travis and recover the stolen weapons around which the movie focuses.</p><p style=\"\">Test edit. </p>",

If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Town &amp; Country Surf Designs: Wood &amp; Water Rage is a NES game published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1870\" href=\"/ljn-ltd/3010-1870\" slug=\"ljn-ltd\">LJN</a> for the US market, using the license of real-life surfboard manufacturer Town &amp; Country Surf Design and specifically a collection of cartoon characters named \"Da Boys\" that the company used for their briefly popular t-shirt designs. Though the game has an American publisher and uses an American license (for an exclusively American market no less), LJN contracted the Japanese development studio <a data-ref-id=\"3010-442\" href=\"/atlus-co-ltd/3010-442\" slug=\"atlus-co-ltd\">Atlus</a> to actually create the game, and they themselves took on <a data-ref-id=\"3010-464\" href=\"/sanritsu/3010-464\" slug=\"sanritsu\">Sanritsu</a> to help complete the workload.</p><p style=\"\">The game is a combination skateboard/surfing game, where the goal of both modes is to successfully make it to the end of the event while scoring as many tricks as possible.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">There are two main modes: Street Skate Session and Big Wave Encounter. There's also an option to play both modes in alternating rounds.</p><p style=\"\">Street Skate Session is a side-scrolling event where the goal is to avoid obstacles on the road by steering up and down the screen (the event has a faux 3D depth to it in the same manner of beat-em-ups like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20752\" href=\"/double-dragon/3030-20752\" slug=\"double-dragon\">Double Dragon</a>) and either jumping with the board (an ollie) or leaping from the board and letting it roll underneath the obstacle while the character goes over it. Reaching the end of the course restarts the event with a slightly longer course. The playable characters for this event are Joe Cool and Tiki Man.</p><p style=\"\">Big Wave Encounter has the player control a surfer on the crest of a big wave. The goal is to complete as many tricks as possible by riding the wave up and jumping at its zenith, though the power of the wave will always push the player backwards while attempting this. Keeping ahead of the wave is necessary if the player doesn't want to fall off the board and lose a life. The playable characters for this event are Thrilla Gorilla and Kool Kat.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><h3><b>Kool Kat</b></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381242-tc16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381242\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381242-tc16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381242\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381242-tc16.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>Tiki Man</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381239-tc13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381239\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381239-tc13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381239\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381239-tc13.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>Joe Cool</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381229-tc3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381229\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381229-tc3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381229\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381229-tc3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381229-tc3.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><h3>Thrilla Gorilla</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381235-tc9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381235\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/692/381235-tc9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-381235\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381235-tc9.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/692/381235-tc9.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure>",

Players control <a href=\"/rockford/3005-19660\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19660\">Rockford</a>, a stick man who navigates a series of caverns filled with <a href=\"/earth/3035-65\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth</a>, <a href=\"/boulder/3055-1468\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1468\">boulders</a>, <a href=\"/diamond/3055-2050\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2050\">diamonds</a> and a series of creatures who kill on touch. The concept is simple: collect enough diamonds to escape each level within a time limit. But while Rockford isn't affected by gravity, the boulders and diamonds are -- remove a piece of earth underneath a boulder and it will fall, often setting off a chain reaction of falling debris. So the game plays as a <a href=\"/puzzles/3015-932\" data-ref-id=\"3015-932\">puzzle game</a>; with each move that the player makes, they have to anticipate the consequences.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Boulder Dash is one of a very short list of titles that began on home machines that were later transferred to the arcades.

One iteration of the game was released in 2007 by <a href=\"/zx-games/3010-2254\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2254\">ZX Games</a>, and is a largely faithful remake of the original over 20 years after its original release. In 2009, a flash-based <a href=\"/browser/3045-140\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">Browser</a> version was released, sporting <a href=\"/remake/3015-340\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\">updated graphics</a>.</p><h3>Virtual Console</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> version of Boulder Dash was released on to the <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Wii Virtual Console</a> on June 1st 2009 for 500 <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> Points.</p>",

      "deck": "Archon: The Light and Dark is a popular hybrid of turn-based, chess-like strategy as well as 2-player action sequences. It has been released on numerous systems including PC, NES, Amiga and C64. The game has also spawned two sequels.",
      "description": "<p style=\"\">Archon is a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-808\" href=\"/chess/3030-808\" slug=\"chess\">Chess</a>-like game where the pieces \"battle\" for squares in an action arcade sequence. The goal is to either destroy every one of the enemy's units, or capture the 4 \"power points\" on the board.</p><p style=\"\">While the two sides, the Light and the Dark, have similar units, their arcade sequence abilities are different.</p><p style=\"\">Half of the board is made up of static black or white squares, while the other half of the board have squares that change color each turn. In the arcade sequences, Light units are stronger on White squares, and Dark units are stronger on Black squares. This relative strength difference manifests in a larger hit point pool for the unit and stronger attack power. Regardless of the underlying square color, some units are naturally stronger than other units.</p><p style=\"\">At the beginning of the game, the color changing squares start in a neutral \"gray\" color, which means units battling on them are at their base strength. Each turn, the changing squares slowly rotate towards full \"White\", then rotate back down towards full \"Black\". As two of the 4 power points are located on these changing squares, it's an important strategic goal to make sure your stronger units claim the power points when the color rotation swings towards your side's faction.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p style=\"\">Similar to Chess, units can move in different directions (or fly over other units) during the turn based phase. When two units are moved onto the same square, the action phase begins.</p><p style=\"\">During the action phase, the game board disappears and is replaced by a battlefield strewn with obstacles. After a brief countdown, the battle begins, and the players control their unit by moving them in 8 directions and using their attack. There is only one type of attack per unit.</p><p style=\"\">While the two factions have similar units in the turn based mode, during the action mode they usually have very different (but balanced) attack modes. For instance, the Light Side has a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-730\" href=\"/phoenix/3015-730\" slug=\"phoenix\">Phoenix</a> which has to stop moving to perform it's limited range <a data-ref-id=\"3015-347\" href=\"/splash-damage/3015-347\" slug=\"splash-damage\">Area of Effect</a> \"explosion\" to damage the enemy, while the Dark <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4834\" href=\"/banshee/3015-4834\" slug=\"banshee\">Banshee</a> can slowly move while engaging it's weaker AoE \"Scream\" attack. The Light Side <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1291\" href=\"/knight/3015-1291\" slug=\"knight\">Knight</a> has a strong melee attack and higher health than it's equivalent Dark Side <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1593\" href=\"/goblins/3015-1593\" slug=\"goblins\">Goblin</a> - but the Goblin is faster and it's melee attack has a longer range.</p><p style=\"\">Additionally, some units can fly over the obstacles on the battlefield, and some units have projectiles that ignore the obstacles.</p><p style=\"\">Depending on the skill of the player as well as the \"color\" of the square the units are battling on, it's possible for very weak units (such as the Goblin) to defeat much stronger units (such as the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2538\" href=\"/golem/3015-2538\" slug=\"golem\">Golem</a>).</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Originally released in 1983 for <a href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">Atari's 8-bit family of computers</a>, Spelunker stars a frail, suspender-clad miner whose goal is to reach the bottom of a colossal cave and find the treasure within. Complicating this task is a variety of instantly fatal obstacles; including geysers, noxious bat guano, malevolent ghosts, and a variety of perilous terrain.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Spelunker was originally developed in 1983 by <a href=\"/micro-graphic-image/3010-2296\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2296\">Micro Graphic Image</a>, which largely consisted of former employees of Games By Apollo, an early third-party developer for the <a href=\"/atari-2600/3045-40\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600</a>, as well as one of the first software companies to declare bankruptcy in the North American video game crash of '83. One of these employees was Tim Martin, whose name is attached to every version of Spelunker, including the 2009 sequel, <a href=\"/spelunker-hd/3030-24055\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24055\">Spelunker HD</a>.</p><p style=\"\">At the time, it was fairly common practice to have a developer's name attached to the title itself, à la <a href=\"/sid-meier/3040-4212\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4212\">Sid Meier</a> or <a href=\"/will-wright/3040-1297\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1297\">Will Wright</a>. While Robert Barber and Cash Foley are credited as co-creating Spelunker, it was decided that Tim would receive top billing as he had developed the \"game logic\" and had come up with the original idea. The developers at MicroGraphic Image were confident that Spelunker would be the first of many games to come so eventually they'd all have their chance to place their name at the front of a game.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, Spelunker was released for <a href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">Atari 8-bit</a> in 1983 while the gaming recession was in full swing. After the initial release, Micro Graphic Image turned publication of Spelunker over to <a href=\"/brderbund-software-inc/3010-404\" data-ref-id=\"3010-404\">Broderbund</a> who then went on to produce the <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a> version of the title, as well as license it out to <a href=\"/irem-software-engineering-inc/3010-1958\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1958\">IREM</a> who created the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> and arcade versions. While Micro Graphic Image never went bankrupt, they ceased operations in 1984.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/510/1183602-spelunker_elevator.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183602\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/510/1183602-spelunker_elevator.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183602\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/510/1183602-spelunker_elevator.png\"></a><figcaption>The opening moments of Spelunker on the NES.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In Spelunker, the hero begins by entering the cave from the very top, with his goal to reach the treasure at the bottom of the massive cavern by traversing over obstacles, climbing ropes, utilizing mine carts, elevators and more. In order to reach his goal, the hero must collect items to replenish his constantly depleting air supply, bombs to clear rocks from the path, keys to open locked doors and other power-ups to aid his quest.</p><p style=\"\">Complicating this task is myriad fatal obstacles. Players are instantly killed when colliding with rushing water, uneven terrain, breakaway ledges, geysers, pillars of fire, and more all threaten the hero. As well as this, there are numerous jumps that require pinpoint accuracy.</p><p style=\"\">The game tends to place the hero in his last known place of safety with no warning and full control, making very rapid deaths a common occurrence for new players.</p><p style=\"\">Ropes are prevalent throughout the cave and represent one of the biggest hazards found in Spelunker. In the NES and <a href=\"/msx/3045-15\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX</a> versions, when the hero is holding on to a rope, the player must press in the direction they want him to jump prior to actually pressing the jump button. This causes the hero to actually shimmy along the rope before jumping, and can cause him to fall off resulting in a death.</p><p style=\"\">B<a href=\"/bats/3015-1688\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1688\">ats</a> inhabit the cave and and drop deadly guano on the player, which can be avoided with carefully timed movements. Bats can also be temporarily neutralized via the use of a flare.</p><p style=\"\">The most deadly of all the creatures, however, are the <a href=\"/ghosts/3015-758\" data-ref-id=\"3015-758\">ghosts</a> that inhabit the cave and are signalled to the player with a musical theme. The hero is armed with a \"flash gun\" that can be used to expel the ghosts, but there are a few caveats to this. First, the player must have a flash gun item in stock, though this is a very common item. The ghost must also be visible on the screen when using the flash gun and in order to use it in the first place, the hero must be standing perfectly still, making him vulnerable to other elements of the cave, not to mention the draining of his oxygen bar.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/510/1183601-spelunker_cosplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183601\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/510/1183601-spelunker_cosplay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1183601\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/510/1183601-spelunker_cosplay.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">In recent years, a totally inexplicable wave of nostalgia for this unfairly difficult platformer has swept through a niche population of Japanese gamers, though the movement continued to gain more mainstream acceptance through the continuing efforts of the most notable licensee of the Spelunker franchise, IREM.</p><p style=\"\">Spelunker made its Japanese debut in December 1985 for the <a href=\"/nes/3055-2794\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2794\">Nintendo Famicom</a> where it is perceived to have sold fairly well, but was also met with a significant backlash. Many players were dismayed at the insane difficulty of the title and either returned or traded it in to used game shops. Over the years, the Famicom version of Spelunker gained a reputation in Japan as something of a mascot of used game bins, as its not uncommon to find dozens of copies of the game at used game shops throughout Japan. This distinction led to many gamers of its era to look back pseudo-fondly on the time they received Spelunker as a child and were utterly destroyed by it.</p><p style=\"\">Spelunker nostalgia is most common in Japanese Internet culture, where the hero can be found starring in videos such as the popular \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4cam0Ji300\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Quest III</a>\" flash animation, fan art on the popular 2ch forum, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGXEJ4woppg\" rel=\"nofollow\">music recitals</a>, cosplay and of course, countless videos found on Nico Video, the \"YouTube of Japan\".</p><p style=\"\">At <a href=\"/tokyo-game-show/3015-2306\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2306\">TGS 2008</a>, IREM announced an HD update to Spelunker called Minna de Spelunker to be released in 2009 for the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> via the <a href=\"/playstation-network/3045-88\" data-ref-id=\"3045-88\">PlayStation Network</a>. While it's commonly referred to as a \"remake\", that is not technically accurate, as Spelunker HD, as the game is called in English-speaking territories, does not contain any of the levels found in any of the original game. Instead, it features a \"retro\" mode that features the classic graphics of the NES version of the title, only with whole new levels and gameplay elements, including online co-op play.</p><p style=\"\">Since the success of Spelunker HD, the nostalgia has only grown stronger; <a href=\"/fromsoftware-inc/3010-760\" data-ref-id=\"3010-760\">From Software</a> used a 3D version of the game's fragile hero as one of the pre-designed templates for the customizable hero in their action-RPG, <a href=\"/3d-dot-game-heroes/3030-27860\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27860\">3D Dot Game Heroes</a>.</p>",

      "deck": "California Games is a multiple event sports game released on multiple 8-bit and 16-bit computers, consoles and handhelds. Developed by 80s legends Epyx, with a reputation for producing multiple-event games, traditional sports were abandoned to accommodate less-established pursuits associated with The Golden State.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Released in 1987 by <a href=\"/epyx-inc/3010-901\" data-ref-id=\"3010-901\">Epyx</a> for a large number of systems, California Games was a collection of minigames based around outdoor activities in non-traditional sports. In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor. The <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>, for example, includes Maxx-Out, Costa Del Mar, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz, Ocean Pacific, Casio, Auzzie, Spin Jammer, and Ray-D-O, while the NES release adds publisher Milton Bradley to the roster.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As a multi-platform game, the visual fidelity of California Games really depends on the machine that is powering it. In general, the art style was heavily informed by Californian imagery. The footbag event has the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. On other platforms where space was at a premium, events were sacrificed. The <a href=\"/lynx/3045-7\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\">Atari Lynx</a> and <a href=\"/atari-2600/3045-40\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">2600</a> releases only included four of the events: BMX, surfing, footbag, and halfpipe.</p><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Each event featured a different soundtrack, including some renditions of well known hits. Richard Berry's song \"Louie Louie\" accompanies the titles, while The Safari's hit \"Wipe Out\" sounds out during the surfing event.</p><h2>Events</h2><h3>Surfing</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Set under a crashing pipeline wave, players gain speed to do aerial tricks and avoid falling off their board. Most versions of the game rate the player on a 10.0 scale, though some give points to the number of rotations in an aerial trick.</p><h3>Halfpipe</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players are given a time limit in which to earn points for rotation and hand plant tricks in a skateboarding half pipe. Not only must they execute these tricks, but they must turn their board in time to descend the ramp and keep momentum into the next trick.</p><h3>Flying Disk</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This event requires throwing a frisbee to a partner off the screen. Players time their button presses to a meter to execute angle and speed and, once released, gain control of the offscreen player the catch the flying disk. Points are earned for successful catches.</p><h3>BMX</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players ride along a dirt track with ramps and obstacles, doing wheelies, flips and spins to earn points. They are also judge on the time it takes to reach the goal, which can be impeded by falling off the bike or crashing.</p><h3>Footbag</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Juggling a hackysack with feet, head, and body, players must keep the bag from touching the ground while doing fancy moves to earn more points. Players can hit seagulls with the bag for bonus points.</p><h3>Roller Skating</h3><p style=\"\" data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Players skate along a path running parallel to the beach, doing tricks and spins while avoiding obstacles on the sidewalk.</p>",

Rock the player is challenged with reaching a lost city filled with treasure at the very bottom of a deep network of caverns. To do this they must guide Digger to the exit at the bottom of each cavern in order to reach the one below. First the secret pillar in each cavern must be located as it is only with this that the exit door can be activated. Once this is accomplished the player will have 60 seconds to reach the exit door and proceed to the next cavern. However each cavern is filled with dangers ranging from hostile creatures to deadly traps. Only by utilizing all the equipment available can the player hope to survive this quest.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p style=\"\">Digger T. Rock tells the story of a young miner of the same name. His love of digging where no one has dug before comes from the many stories he has heard of hidden treasures to be found by those brave enough to venture into the unknown.

Loose earth can mask sheer drops leading to certain death for anyone unlucky enough to try and dig through it. Deadly ice can be found which can cause a player to slide straight off ledges and to their deaths. Enormous wasps can freeze the player with a sting from their tail, mysterious rock formations can teleport the player to unknown parts of the cavern, deadly creatures crawl along the ground looking to bite at anything that gets in their way, Ghosts, Cavemen and Skeletons patrol the deeper caverns trying to drive away any would be explorers and even Dinosaurs can be found guarding cavern exits.</p><h2>Supplies</h2><p style=\"\">In order for the player to survive this journey they will have to make good use of the supplies they can find in each cavern. There are 4 primary tools the player has at their disposal:</p><h3>Shovel/Throwing Rocks</h3><p style=\"\">The player can always turn to their shovel in a time of need. Enemies must be close for it to be effective but rapid swings of it can lay waste to most enemies you’ll encounter. It goes hand in hand with the throwing rocks that it digs up. These can be hurled at enemies from a safe distance and can be found all over the caverns.</p><h3>Rope Ladders</h3><p style=\"\">Ladders can be dropped from any ledge giving the player safe passage to the lower areas of any cavern. Limited in number however the player must use caution that there is not another way down before turning to their rope ladders.</p><h3>Dynamite</h3><p style=\"\">Sticks of dynamite can be used to destroy the more powerful enemies you’ll encounter. It can also be vital in destroy barricades and weak walls leading the player to hidden secrets and the eventual exit from the cavern.</p><h3>Jewels</h3><p style=\"\">Jewels are found all over the caverns and have a few uses (some more secret than others). The basic use is to trade them with underground villages for other supplies. A single jewel can buy 8 sticks of dynamite, 8 rope ladders or 26 throwing rocks.</p>",

Stanley is a bugman who is protecting his green house from Donkey Kong, who is stirring up the bugs creating them to attack Stanley and steal his precious flowers. Stanley starts off equipped with a Bee Smoker but can upgrade to a super can later on. The whole game is based around Donkey Kong disrupting a hive of bees while Stanley tries to defeat Kong by repeatedly hitting him till he retreats and repeating the process till the last level. The player can lose the game three different ways: They can get hit by a bee or another object; they can ignore Donkey Kong for too long he will jump down and deal with Stanley personally; or they can let the bees steal all of the flowers.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915018-donkey_kong_3_vc_friday_cg_32476432_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915018\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915018-donkey_kong_3_vc_friday_cg_32476432_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915018\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915018-donkey_kong_3_vc_friday_cg_32476432_002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Stanley tries to knock Donkey Kong down.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Donkey Kong 1 and 2 had a very specific platformer gameplay mechanic and technique whereas the third Donkey Kong 3 has a change in gameplay, becoming more like a shooter. The game is a simple shooter which borrows many ideas and concept from an older game called <a href=\"/space-firebird/3030-34126\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34126\">Space Firebird</a>. The whole game only consists of three different levels which makes the long term goal to protect the flowers from the enemy. Throughout these levels though are a fair amount of varied enemies. Attempting to deter Stanley are Buzzbee, Beespy, Queen Bee, Creepy The Snake, Buttifly, Stag Beetle, Moth, and Beebomb. Stanley (the protagonist and person the player controls) resembles the famous Mario by wearing suspenders, which are in this case blue. Stanley must protect his flowers from these insects as they try to steal and destroy them. While this is happening Donkey Kong hangs from two vines and aggravates the insects' hives and if not taken care of will come down and attack Stanley personally making the player lose a life. Stanley must use his bug spray to shoot the insects and shoot Donkey Kong to make him climb higher. The level is complete once Donkey Kong climbs to the top of the screen, or every insect is destroyed. Higher up on the vine is a power up that Donkey Kong will drop down once he reaches it. This power up upgrades the bug spray to Super Spray which shoots much faster, does not have a limited range, and destroys all insects in its path. Shooting Super Spray is the only way to destroy Creepy The Snake, who is only temporarily frozen by the standard bug spray. The levels just repeat until the game is reset or the player runs out of flowers to defend.</p><h2>History</h2><p style=\"\">Donkey Kong 3 was originally a 1980s arcade games much like the other Donkey Kong games. It was later on ported to the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, and <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">GBA</a> later on. The game is now available on the <a href=\"/wii-shop/3045-87\" data-ref-id=\"3045-87\">Wii Shop</a>. The original game was released on the NES in 1986, and the emulated version on the <a href=\"/wii/3045-36\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> was released July 14, 2008 in North America and in Europe January 9th, 2009. The Donkey Kong series prior to 3 were known for dodging objects while platforming up the screen. This Donkey Kong took a different turn and turned itself into a \"fixed shooter.\"</p>",

In it, you play as a member of the WCPO (World Central Police Organization/世界刑事警察機構) named Albatross who is trying to rescue his partner, Leila, from the evil organization bent on world domination called \"GELDRA\". There are a couple of minor differences between the arcade and Famicom versions of the game; these mostly revolve around the types of maskers encountered, the number of them encountered (the arcade version has a vastly greater number of enemies attacking Albatross) and the speed of their bullets (their bullets travel much faster in the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21\" slug=\"nes\">famicom</a> version, making reacting trickier at times!). The game features 10 stages.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1665838-leilaalba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1665838\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1524822695035\" data-width=\"282\" style=\"width: 282px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1665838-leilaalba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1665838\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1665838-leilaalba.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The player must help Albatross make his way through various GELDRA bases in search of clues to the location of their HQ and to rescue Leila. To do so, the player guiding him will need quick reflexes. Albatross is armed with a pistol which can be shot rapidly; if the player should run out of ammo, the last bullet will regenerate over time, but this seriously impedes the player's rate of fire. Albatross is capable of touching an enemy twice before dying, or being shot/hit by a grenade/burned with flames/etc. a single time before losing a life.</p><p style=\"\">In many stages there are two or more \"levels\" (a ground floor and a catwalk of some sort) that the player can stand on; the player can switch between them by either hitting up and jump or down and jump. Sometimes there are objects (or not, as the issue is generally a lack of a hand rail) which will prevent the player from dropping down from the upper level. In addition, doors are spaced throughout all stages. These doors serve three purposes: Firstly, they are a point of entry for GELDRA agents, termed \"maskers\". Secondly, they are a place for Albatross to hide from the maskers. Be careful though, as if a masker sees you enter, he won't be afraid to simply stand in front of the door! Thirdly some doors are labeled \"ammo\" or \"arms\". The \"arms\" doors temporarily grant Albatross the ability to use a machine gun. When the ammo runs out, Albatross returns to using his normal pistol. The \"ammo\" doors simply contain extra ammo for Albatross' pistol. At the end of each stage, the player is treated to a cutscene of maskers watching other maskers harassing Leila via a massive monitor, either stripping her of clothing, electrocuting her, or performing some other diabolical and villainous deed.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Albatross</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1665891-albatrossface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1665891\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0714285714286\" data-width=\"140\" style=\"width: 140px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1665891-albatrossface.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1665891\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1665891-albatrossface.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1665891-albatrossface.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">The main protagonist.

It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's <a href=\"/bicycle/3055-1171\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1171\">bicycle</a> on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.</p><p style=\"\">There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.</p><p style=\"\">Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.</p><p style=\"\">At the end of the street is the \"Training Course\", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.</p><h3><u><span>Enemies</span></u></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4511/252595-paperboygameplay.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252595\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4511/252595-paperboygameplay.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-252595\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4511/252595-paperboygameplay.png\"></a><figcaption>Danger Lurks</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, <a href=\"/mailbox/3055-2976\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2976\">mailboxes</a>, <a href=\"/shrub/3055-3894\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3894\">bushes</a>, <a href=\"/trash-can/3055-268\" data-ref-id=\"3055-268\">garbage cans</a>, push-mowers, <a href=\"/fence/3055-1766\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1766\">fences</a>, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life.

Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.</p><p style=\"\">A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.</p><p style=\"\">The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.</p>",

The ninja magic can be used to add different abilities to the protagonist such as ninja stars or flame strikes. A health bar is present at the top of the screen and will grow with power-ups. Each level is designed with increasing difficulty and while there may be no save option in the original Arcade version once a hostage is rescued they stay rescued. The player will only have to power through the regular enemies while making their way back to the point of death. Power-ups will not respawn.</p><p style=\"\">There are mini-games between the 5 missions and 19 rounds which have the camera looking from Joe's eyes in the first person. These mini-games have the player shooting ninja stars at anything from targets to flying ninjas who have some ninja stars of their own.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><p style=\"\">The Two-Mega cartridge used for Shinobi was unable to handle the full animations from the arcade version, but most of the sprites were kept the same. The color count in each system was slightly different, the NES version being the lowest and the Arcade being the highest.</p><h2>Audio</h2><p style=\"\">Different versions were again limited by their cartridge capacity and console. The SMS version used BGM_A music, boss music and bonus round music. The arcade was the only edition to use digital voice, all others used analog sound effects instead.</p>",

      "deck": "A LJN NES game based on the movie franchise of the same name. Players take control of a boat, plane, and submarine to hunt down the mysterious terror of the deep known as Jaws. This game is based on Jaws: The Revenge, the fourth and final film of the series.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Jaws is an NES game released in 1987 by publisher LJN; it is based on the movie franchise of the same name. The game itself is more akin to the fourth and final Jaws, Jaws: The Revenge, than the other three films. Jaws features top-down, side-view, and first-person gameplay.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383449-jaws3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383449\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.71129032258065\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383449-jaws3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383449\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383449-jaws3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\"</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game starts out in top-down view at the port located on the left side of the game map. The goal is to navigate the boat across an open sea to reach the ports at opposite ends. By doing this the player acquires (in exchange for conch shells) a device useful for tracking Jaws, as well as gain increased attack power for attacking Jaws itself. While in the open sea, the boat will randomly \"hit\" things. The game will switch from a top-down view (as the boat) to a side-view (as the boat or the diver). If the boat runs into small sea creatures and not Jaws, the boat will immediately release a diver into the water in which the player then controls. If Jaws hits the boat instead, it will temporarily be possible to attack Jaws with the boat's depth charges. Once Jaws physically hits the boat in side-view, the boat disappears and the diver is released. It's also possible to fight Jaws in the side-view mode if it happens to be nearby when the boat hits something else (eventually showing up on the scene). It's worth mentioning that Jaws (for some reason) cannot harm the diver while he's at the very top of the screen. This is good to remember when Jaws is around.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Denizens of the Deep</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383926-jaws5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383926\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.74074074074074\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383926-jaws5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383926\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383926-jaws5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Say hello to my little friends.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once in side-scrolling view, the diver will have to face dangerous sea life including: sting rays, jelly fish, smaller sharks, and sometimes Jaws. When killed creatures will drop one of three different items the diver can collect: crabs (speed up the diver), starfish (points), and conch shells (a form of currency in the game). One can speculate that the smaller sharks are perhaps Jaws' own offspring, as they often accompany Jaws while attacking. Once enough of the smaller sharks have been killed, a mini \"bonus game\" will be initiated. The player will then be switched to a side-view flying a plane over the ocean. The goal is to bomb jellyfish as they move around in varying patterns below. The plane can be sped up or slowed down by simply holding down left or right on the D-pad (depending which direction the plane is flying). After the last wave of jellyfish the player is rewarded conch shells based on how many they hit and the bonus game ends.</p><h3>We all live in a...orange submarine?</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383380-jaws8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383380\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.74032258064516\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383380-jaws8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383380\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383380-jaws8.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383380-jaws8.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The submarine: pure awesome in 8-bit form</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">At some point in the game (usually after the two ports have been visited enough times and powered up) a submarine will appear somewhere on the game map. Navigate the boat over to it, and the sub can be used. Once acquired, the boat will release the submarine into the water instead of the diver. The submarine has two different attacks (torpedoes and depth charges), and moves much easier through the water compared to the diver. The drawback is that the \"top of the screen\" trick no longer works. If either Jaws or another creature hits the sub, the diver releases from it and it can no longer be used. In some cases it is possible to reacquire the submarine after it has been lost. Regaining power levels after losing a life, for example, could cause the submarine to reappear on the game map.</p><h2>The Final Fight</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383928-jaws10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383928\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75161290322581\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2262/383928-jaws10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-383928\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383928-jaws10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2262/383928-jaws10.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Smile you son of a...\"</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once the ports have been visited enough times and the attack rating has been sufficiently powered up, the player will then be able to inflict enough damage on Jaws in side-view. Bringing Jaws' power bar all the way down will initiate the final confrontation with Jaws. This fight takes place in first-person perspective with the player controlling the front of the boat. The objective here is to force Jaws to jump out the water (using the A Button), and then ramming it with the front of the boat (using the B Button). Jaws needs to be lined up perfectly with the boat, and the right distance away, for this to work. It can be tricky, but with practice it's easy to learn where Jaws needs to be. Once Jaws has been impaled with the front of the boat the game cuts to the ending and credits.</p>",

These will increase his firepower (turning his basic weapon into powerful axes and boomerangs - common weapons for Hudson protagonists) and speed as well as replenish his health (unlike many shoot-em-up protagonists, DinoRiki can take several hits before dying) and increase the player's score.</p><p style=\"\">A difficult aspect of this game is avoiding instant death traps like large bodies of water, which need to be jumped over, and getting caught by the constantly scrolling screen.</p>",

      "description": "<p style=\"\">Swords and Serpents is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-165\" href=\"/dungeon-crawling/3015-165\" slug=\"dungeon-crawling\">dungeon crawler</a> releasd in 1990 and developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-580\" href=\"/interplay-entertainment-corp/3010-580\" slug=\"interplay-entertainment-corp\">Interplay</a>. The game does not have a strong emphasis on storyline. The basic plot is that the player is tasked with defeating a serpent, which is at the bottom level of a 16 level dungeon. The game is a simple exercise in destroying <a data-ref-id=\"3025-167\" href=\"/dungeons-dragons/3025-167\" slug=\"dungeons-dragons\">Dungeons and Dragons</a> style monsters, collecting loot, and leveling characters up. The game can be played by one or two platers using any NES controller or joystick, or it can be controlled by four players using a multitap device and four controllers or joysticks. The first player, who is also the party leader, controls the movements of the party through the levels of the dungeon, but every player is allowed to control their characters decisions during battles. <br/><br/>When a new game is started each character can be one one of three classes: thief, magician, or warrior. The player can decide to design a new character and choose their attributes, or can use a pre-made character. Swords and Serpents does not contain a backup battery for saving, so a password system is used for saving and restoring games. A series of five passwords is used to restore a game. One password is for the overall game progress, and the other four passwords are for the four party members. <br/><br/>The interface and gameplay is extremely simplified, making for a casual role playing game experience. Especially when compared to other similar role playing games on the system, specifically the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-209\" href=\"/wizardry/3025-209\" slug=\"wizardry\">Wizardry</a> series.</p>",

The game has four \"Lands,\" each consisting of a set number of stages. At the end of each \"Land,\" Kickle must face, and defeat, a different boss. Each level can be cleared by collecting three red dream bags, which can be spread out or packed together. The ultimate goal of the game is to defeat the Wicked Wizard King and return the Fantasy Kingdom back to normal.</p><p style=\"\">The game's Japanese name is Meikyuu Shima (迷宮島, lit. \"Labyrinth Island\" or \"Maze Island\") and the NES version is actually a port of an older Arcade game. The Japanese version allows the player to select levels in any order within the same Land, and is generally harder.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Kickle is assisted in his efforts by his ability to breathe cold air on enemies and turn them into ice. Some enemies simply smash apart when touched, but others form into cubes. Kickle can then kick these cubes across the level to create walkways and bridges, or use them as shields to protect himself from enemies. However, these cubes will keep going until they hit an obstacle, and they will eliminate Kickle himself if he happens to be in their path. </p><p style=\"\">In addition, Kickle can also form ice pillars which will also block enemies. These ice pillars can only be formed on tiles made of ice. Both the ice cubes and pillars will melt and disappear after a few moments.</p>",

He must avoid the monkeys by jumping over them - blue ones in particular move very quickly so the player must keep alert.</li><li>Ball Balancing - Charlie must make his way across a series of large, striped balls that spin in place. Since Charlie jumps a specific distance that cannot be altered, the player must judge the correct distance between the ball they're on, and the one they're aiming for and jump at the right moment.</li><li>Trick Riding - Charlie is riding a pony and must hop off and jump on trampolines as they pass overhead. Keeping a rhythm will allow Charlie to land back on the pony once the trampolines have passed.</li><li>Trapeze Swinging - Charlie must leap between each trapeze swing as they reach the end of their arc in order to reach the next one. He can also use the trampolines beneath to move from one swing to the next.</li></ol><p style=\"\">With each of these events, the player can earn additional bonus points by performing risky or difficult actions and pulling them off, thus entertaining the crowd even more. These include the smaller fire rings during the Lion Taming act, jumping over multiple monkeys during the Tightrope or hopping across several trampolines in a row with the Trick Riding event. The player can earn extra lives by earning a lot of points on all these events. After completing any of the five acts, the player can opt to play a more difficult version of the same challenge for additional points.</p>",

Also, instead of being a top-down game like its predecessors, Ys III is a side-scrolling action-platformer.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p style=\"\">Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the <a href=\"/ys/3025-112\" data-ref-id=\"3025-112\">Ys</a> series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in <a href=\"/ys-book-i-ii/3030-13964\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13964\">Ys I &amp; II</a>, <a href=\"/adol-christin/3005-2477\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2477\">Adol</a> and his companion, <a href=\"/dogi/3005-11825\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11825\">Dogi</a>, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.</p><p style=\"\">Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.</p><p style=\"\">Ys III would be remade as <a href=\"/ys-the-oath-in-felghana/3030-839\" data-ref-id=\"3030-839\">Ys: The Oath in Felghana</a> for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from <a href=\"/ys-the-ark-of-napishtim/3030-19621\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19621\">Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim</a>. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.</p><p style=\"\">When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, \"...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game\".</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p style=\"\">Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a <a href=\"/top-down-perspective/3015-788\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down perspective</a>, Ys III is played from a <a href=\"/side-scrolling/3015-299\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\">side-scrolling</a> perspective not unlike another <a href=\"/nihon-falcom-corp/3010-849\" data-ref-id=\"3010-849\">Falcom</a>-developed title, <a href=\"/sorcerian/3030-2411\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2411\">Sorcerian</a>. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to <a href=\"/jump/3015-379\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump</a>. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much <a href=\"/backtracking/3015-239\" data-ref-id=\"3015-239\">back-tracking</a> as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.</p><p style=\"\">As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> ( <a href=\"/turbografx-cd/3045-53\" data-ref-id=\"3045-53\">TGCD</a>) or not ( <a href=\"/snes/3045-9\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a>). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss fights</a>.</p>",
